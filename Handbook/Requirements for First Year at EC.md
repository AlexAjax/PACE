### Requirements for the First Year at Emory College

The following courses must be taken within the first year of enrollment at Emory College:

 **1. PACE 101**
PACE 101 is a mandatory course offered in the fall semester for all first-year students. The course is designed to help students to excel at Emory College. Students are required to enroll into one of the course sections. 

**2. Health GER**
All first-year students will take a Personal Health course in their first semester to complete the health requirement. This is a one-hour course, and must be taken on a graded basis.

**3. First-Year Writing Requirement**
The first-year writing requirement must be taken in the fall, spring, or summer of the first year. Students may receive AP/IB credit to fulfill the first-year writing requirement. All sections of the following courses will fulfill the first-year writing requirement:
- ENG 101 (Expository Writing) is designed for those who want training and practice in expository writing. The learning process in the course is keyed to the student's own writing and the examination of examples of their writing in class.
- ENG 181 (Writing about Literature) and CPLT 110 (Intro to Literary Studies) emphasize the development of the student's critical writing skills in conjunction with the close reading and analysis of literary texts. Both courses are taught in small individual sections either by regular faculty members or by advanced graduate students. The student's own preference will largely influence his or her choice.
**4. First-Year Seminar**
All students must take a First-Year Seminar during their first year (Fall or Spring Semester). Students should keep in mind that they do not have to choose a seminar in the field in which they expect to major. This is an opportunity to explore courses and ideas they might find interesting.
