### Changes in the Handbook
We have made several changes to the formatting of this handbook in order to improve readability and to make the handbook easier to use. Outlines of the PACE advising meetings for Fall 2013 are now available in reader-friendly style, and we have moved the academic calendar, copies of College forms, and contact information to the back of the handbook to make these sections more accessible. Please note the newly expanded materials detailing strategies for addressing student concerns.
