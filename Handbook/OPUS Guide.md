The Degree Audit (Advisee Requirement Report) is a *tool* used to guide students in completion of their GERs. This advising document shows your student's progress towards fulfilling the GERS. Each GER Area-for instance, Area II, The Continuing Writing Requirement-is displayed as a separate section of the document. To view a different GER Area scroll up or down the page using the arrow keys on the far right-hand side of the screen. Under each GER Area heading, it will be specified in bold lettering whether the student has "Satisfied" or "Not Satisfied" this area of the GERs. Use the green arrows to expand or collapse details.
If the message reads "Satisfied," there will be a listing directly below specifying the classes that have fulfilled this requirement, with each class displayed on a separate row. On the far right-hand side of this chart, will be a column entitled "Status." Within this column, there will be one of the three icons, indicating if the class is either taken or completed, "in progress" or "planned."
