## 2013-2014 Advising Meeting Guide 
This section provides information about when you can expect to interact with your advisees and what they expect about the goals of particular meetings.  In the appendix, you will find detailed, step-by-step suggestions that you may find helpful for framing your meetings.  

### Letters of Introduction
**Early to Mid August**
 
First-year students are completing Blackboard modules designed to prepare them for productive advising conversations when they arrive on campus. These modules cover Emory College's GERs and academic policies, the Emory Honor Code, and basic considerations for forming balanced course schedules.
You will be assigned advisees **in early August**; when the pairings are posted to OPUS, **students will introduce themselves to you via email**. The final Blackboard module details the elements of polite electronic correspondence, and suggests that students include information in their introductions that may be helpful as you prepare to meet in August.
**You need not reply.**  We have reminded students that advising does not begin until their arrival in August, and that many faculty members are on vacation or otherwise unavailable until the twenty-sixth of August.  **If you do choose to reply, you may reassure students that there will be plenty of time to discuss their concerns when they arrive.**
