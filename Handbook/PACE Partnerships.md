### PACE Partnerships

#### Faculty Adviser
As a PACE Faculty Adviser, you greatly influence the academic lives of first-year students. The PACE program aims to provide faculty and students with resources to foster productive and meaningful relationships between advisers and advisees. Your role in getting to know students and helping them define their academic goals and interests is extremely valuable.
#### Student Leaders 
We will continue to assign Orientation Leaders (OLs) to departments to assist faculty advisers during the morning of August 26. OLs will assist first-year students and faculty members with the technical aspects of registration and the selection of courses on the 26. OLs will also be assigned to an Orientation group of first-year students with varied interests and will play a key role for first-year students throughout the academic year.
#### First-Year Students
Beginning this summer, first-year students have been completing Blackboard modules designed to introduce them to academic life at Emory and prepare for meetings with their faculty advisers. If you are interested in accessing the PACE modules on Blackboard, you may request guest access to the student PACE Blackboard website by emailing s.a.alexander@emory.edu. You may also refer to Section II.
#### Families
Parents, guardians, and families often play an important role in the academic lives of our students. We communicate regularly with families and you may refer them to the OUE if they have any questions or concerns.
