## Components
The PACE Program is about building connections. Relationships between first-year students and their faculty and peer advisers are two of its core components. The other two components support and supplement these: PACE Orientation prepares students to build these one-on-one relationships, while PACE 101 helps students continue these relationships and helps them connect with offices, programs, and opportunities in the broader Emory landscape.
### PACE Orientation
- Series of online modules
- Helps students prepare to build academic plans in conversations with faculty advisers and OLs

- Teaches students to compose professional email, including their introductions to faculty advisersÂ 
- Contact Alex Alexander at s.a.alexander@emory.edu for access to the site 

### Connections between OLs, Students, and Faculty Advisers
