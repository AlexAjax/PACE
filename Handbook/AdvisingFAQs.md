#### What steps can a student take if he or she cannot enroll in one or more classes on OPUS?
A number of issues can prevent students from enrolling in courses. A course may be full, have the required prerequisites, or the student may not have an active enrollment appointment. Please remind the student to verify on OPUS if one of these causes is the case. If a course is full, encourage the student to create alternative schedules or reach out to an OUE academic adviser for supplemental assistance. Also, a student may have a hold(s) placed on his or her account that prevents registration. It is the student's responsibility to verify if there is a hold on OPUS and to contact the correct administrative department that has issued the hold (e.g., Student Financial Services, the Office for Undergraduate Education, etc.) in order to take the necessary steps toward having the hold(s) released.
#### What should a student do if his or her transcript on OPUS appears incorrect?**
If a student notices that any AP, IB, or other transferred credits are missing from or have been posted incorrectly on his or her transcript, he or she may contact the Office of Admission to make an appeal to have the transcript corrected.
#### What advice should I give students who are interested in taking a course on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading basis?**
A student may elect to take up to 20 of the total semester hours required for graduation from any department or division of the College with the stipulation that grades for courses so elected will be recorded as Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory only and shall not be counted in computing the student's GPA. The grade of Satisfactory carries full academic credit; the grade of Unsatisfactory carries no academic credit. No course used to satisfy GERs may be taken on an S/U basis, except for Physical Education courses. Please be aware that students cannot initiate a change to the grading basis of a class after the sixteenth calendar day from the first day of classes in the College. This deadline falls on Wednesday, September 11, 2013 for the Fall 2013 semester.
#### What are some examples of a balanced course load?**
A balanced course load differs from student to student. It is very important to weigh the student's goals for the semester alongside realistic outcomes. When considering the number of academic credit hours to take, many students will take five academic courses, plus a one-credit physical education course, in order to make adequate progress on their degrees with this year's credit hour changes. Students who enroll in mostly three credit-hour courses under the new credit hour system will average five academic courses each semester. Students taking four- and five-credit hour courses will take four academic courses on average. The Office for Undergraduate Education recommends that students take a combination of courses that will both help students make progress toward choosing a major and fulfill GERs.
For those students interested in pre-health sequences, a balanced course load is recommended for succeeding in rigorous science courses. Please refer to Section VII: Pre-professional Areas of this handbook on pre-health advising or instruct students to schedule an appointment with a pre-health adviser in the Pre-Health Mentoring Office by calling 727-6040.
