##### Catalog Description
Seminar on various anthropological topics. Satisfies general education Freshman Seminar.

##### Semester Description
Content: Freshmen Only

Dead men (and women) do tell tales.  We will use the methods of paleopathology (the study of disease in prehistory) to reveal patterns of trauma, nutritional disease, evidence of antibiotic use, infections, markers of activity found on the human skeleton. You will learn the essentials of skeletal biology such as the determination of age, sex, stature, pathology, and activity markers by “hands-on” examination of the human skeleton. The pattern of pathological indicators will be used to reconstruct how our ancestors lived and died.  Patterns of disease are not a matter of chance but reflect the culture and environment in which we live.  You do not need to have a background in science.  An incredible curiosity, the deductive ability of a detective and the tenacity of a scientist are required.  A case study approach will be used.  Readings will be available on-line. You will be required to write six one page reports on the case studies and a term paper on an issue raised in the class research.

####Semester Description:
Views of Rome: Ancient and Baroque

Under the Roman emperors from Augustus to Constantine, as well as the popes of the baroque period, from Sixtus V to Clement XII, the urban fabric of Rome was indelibly altered and the city embellished with works of art and architecture which continue to shape modern perceptions of the city.  The course examines the formal and conceptual resonances between ancient and baroque Rome, as well as the impact of ancient art and architecture on the daring innovations of the baroque period.  The endurance of the classical tradition and urbanism in both periods will also be focal points of the course.  We will explore the development of the Roman Forum, the imperial residences on the Palatine hill and Nero’s fabled palace (the Domus Aurea), the Pantheon, the Mausoleum of Hadrian (modern Castel S. Angelo) Perino del Vaga, the Colosseum, St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Palace, the Villa Borghese, Palazzo Barberini, Palazzo Spada, Piazza Navona, Piazza del Popolo, and the Fontana di Trevi.  The course will also examine the Roman careers of  artists or architects including Caravaggio, Bernini, Borromini, and Pietro da Cortona.  The course is offered in conjunction with an exhibition at the Michael C. Carlos Museum, “Antichità, Teatro, Magnificenza: Renaissance and Baroque Images of Rome” and students will have extensive involvement with the 16th-18th century engravings and etchings featured in the exhibition.

##### Catalog Description
Fall. Prerequisite or co-requisite: Chemistry 141 or 171. Major topics include: cell structure and function, cell reproduction, and Mendelian genetics. Along with Biology 142 meets the requirements for medical and dental school and the biology major.

##### Semester Description
Content: Biology 141 and 142 will provide a topic-driven overview of molecular and cellular biology and genetics.  The second semester will cover evolution, genomics, molecular, developmental, and cancer genetics.  The topics covered in class will address major issues in human biology and medicine.  The integrated lecture and lab will emphasize the basic principles and critical thinking involved in modern biological discovery.  In lab, students will design and perform experiments using several important model systems.

Biology 141 and 142 are required of all Biology majors, and Biology 141, along with Chemistry 141, should be taken in the fall of the Freshman year by prospective biology majors.  If scheduling precludes taking both, it is recommended that you take Chemistry 141 before taking Biology 141.  Biology 141 and 142 are prerequisites for all Biology courses above the 100 level.  AP Biology scores of 4 or 5 count for Biology 141.  These courses now include classical and molecular genetics and meet the biology premedical requirements.  

Some lecture and lab exams may be administered in the evening.

##### Catalog Description 
An introduction to the urban life and city planning of the ancient world, including the ancient Near East, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.

##### Semester Description
The main goal of this course is to familiarize students with the development of urban life and the development of cities in the ancient world. Students should come away from this course with a specific knowledge of important city centers in Classical Antiquity and with a general sense of the inception and transformation of the city within the ancient civilizations of the Near East, Egypt, Greece, Etruria, and Rome with a special emphasis on Athens and Rome.

General areas of study will include:

-Works of architecture and art as both individual units and as parts
   of complexes, paying particular attention to programs of design
   including both the structures themselves and the furnishings which
   would have completed them
       
-The development of other elements essential to the infrastructure of
   urban life including, but not limited to, roads,    sewers, the
   establishment of building codes and their changes    throughout time,
   and water supplies (springs, fountains, and    aqueducts)

More complex themes and questions to be considered will include:

-Advantages and disadvantages of organic vs. planned development
   
-why cities evolve and how do they change over time


-the role of the site in the evolution of an urban landscape
  

-what elements, if any, are universal in cities of different cultures
   and what elements are different and culturally determined
   

-social structure and the divided city
       use of architecture and architectural complexes to create a national and/or personal identity and history
  

-structuring and restructuring of an urban environment for   
   socio-political reasons
          the effects of ancient urban structures and infrastructures on modern cities such as Athens and Rome.

##### Grading
Assignment/Exam: 2 Midterms; Research Paper/Project (including topic, outline, etc. during the semester); 1-2 practical projects; and a Final Examination. Other small written assignments, projects, or quizzes will be added as needed. Failure to complete ANY of the major assignments (midterm, final, presentation, written assignments, projects, or Final Paper/Project) will result in a failing grade for the course.

##### Semester Description
Content: Machines and their products have come to occupy an increasingly present role in daily life. For the past two centuries especially, the integration of new technologies has meant large changes for how humans produce, exchange, and store information. Nowhere else has this become more obvious in the case of personal computers compared to their more ancient counterparts—books. In this course, we will read and write about the human relationship to differing modes of textual creation, the ways in which this relationship changes with new inventions, as well as the way new machines can be designed to meet evolving needs for textual interaction. Together, we will engage in symbolic exchange across texts from the early 20th century to present, and question what it means for a text to have relevance today and tomorrow.

##### Semester Description
Content: Autobiography is at once the most natural and the most daunting of writing endeavors. There is no subject matter more familiar to writers than their own lives. However, such writing poses unique challenges. Are autobiographers ever able to achieve an objective distance from their writing process? What duty do they have not to misrepresent themselves to others? We will read the memoirs and autobiographies of various authors, analyzing how each work constructs and conveys a persona. As writers ourselves, we will adopt the techniques we observe in the texts for our use. We will learn to develop an effective ethos, primarily in critical writing and secondarily in creative writing.

##### Catalog Description 
An introduction to literary studies, combined with an intensive writing approach. From the broad perspective of world literature, consideration of topics such as desire, language, and identity. Fulfills the first-year writing requirement.

##### Semester Description
Content: In The Braindead Megaphone George Saunders compares contemporary media to a party guest with a megaphone who, through the sole credential of volume, steers conversation and language, and sets an “intelligence ceiling” on discourse. Saunders argues that we must turn that Megaphone down, and insist that what's said through it be as precise, intelligent, and humane as possible.” In this class, students will attempt to do just that. We will begin where we are and consider what literature might mean in a contemporary, globalized culture. We will focus on recent literary and theoretical texts and think about how we both adapt to today’s “megaphone” culture and resist it. Our project will be twofold: first, we will attempt to understand and articulate the importance of contemporary writing; second, we will learn to respond to this writing in a manner that is critical and engaged. By the end of the term, students should be comfortable producing effective writing in various media, responding critically to diverse texts, and tuning out the braindead megaphone.

##### Catalog Description 
An introduction to literary studies, combined with an intensive writing approach. From the broad perspective of world literature, consideration of topics such as desire, language, and identity. Fulfills the first-year writing requirement.

##### Semester Description
Content:What is a critic and in what relation does she stand to the work of art? This course introduces students to key issues of literature by examining works that reflect the role of the critic in shaping our understanding of art and the world that it inhabits. We will pay special attention to the ways in which the critical reader is often represented within the text and consider how literature itself can be thought of as kind of criticism. Throughout the course, we will also be attuned to the social apparatuses (the university, the military and penal system etc.) that organize our reality. Our readings will be drawn from various genres including the essay, short story, drama, poetry, and film. As this course fulfills the first-year writing requirement, I require that students pick up additional style guides. All other texts are on Direct Reserve unless specified.

##### Catalog Description 
An introduction to literary studies, combined with an intensive writing approach. From the broad perspective of world literature, consideration of topics such as desire, language, and identity. Fulfills the first-year writing requirement.

##### Semester Description
Content: Modern literary and artistic forms are often read as attempts to represent the “signs of the times,” to capture the endless succession of transformations that characterize “our” historical situation. Thus the transformation of lyric poetry carried out by poets like Charles Baudelaire and Walt Whitman; the renovation of prosaic language enacted by writers such as José Martí or Virginia Woolf; or the profound revolution in artistic practice that occurs in the works of Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol are read alternatively as symptoms and causes--as agents and products--of modernity.  This course sets out to explore the ways in which modern literature and art emerges as an attempt to both produce and represent the historical changes that make it possible. How do literary texts respond to historical processes such as the spread of democracy, the rise of new technologies, and the splintering of “cultural life” into highly specialized realms of autonomous practices, which are often taken as the hallmarks of modernization? We will read texts across national, linguistic, historical and disciplinary boundaries in an attempt to come to terms with the question of modern literature’s relation to the history of modernity.

##### Text

 Readings will include-Selections from Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire, José Martí, Lautréamont, Walt Whitman, Virginia Woolf, Jorge Luis Borges, and Gertrude Stein. We might also read theoretical selections from Marx, Benjamin, de Man and Foucault.

##### Semester Description
Content: This class will explore what is at stake in coping with mortality as lovers (or with love as mortals). The relation between our own deaths and sexual desire could be said to constitute a more general skein of the fabric of many different societies across space and time. We shall try to untangle four such polymorphous yarns, following the threads of love and death along with their permutations and aberrations in texts from Ancient Greece, France, Germany and Brazil. Emphasis will be placed on the concrete images and figures with the help of which literature condenses and displaces the distinctive conjunctions of love-death in different traditions. Some theoretical framework will be given by slowly (but surely) introducing students to works by Freud and Heidegger.

### CPLT190-000: First-year Seminar: What is Freedom?

|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|TTH|1:00PM-2:15PM|Ignatius Few Building 129|Bhaumik, Srabanti|FSEM|3|	2600|

##### Semester Description
Content: free·dom  (ˈfrēdəm) Noun
 1. The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without
    hindrance or restraint.
 2. Absence of subjection to foreign domination or despotic government.

This freshmen seminar will take up the following exciting question what is freedom? Through a range of writings, we will consider how this important question has been approached in literature, law, song, drama and film, poetry, and philosophy. The philosopher Hannah Arendt would famously argue, for instance, that freedom is constituted through relations between political actors rather than in an isolated experience of the self. We will read a diverse body of writing from Aristotle’s classical fragments, abolitionist narratives advocating for the end of slavery in the nineteenth-century, theorists of non-violence such as Henry David Thoreau and Mahatma Gandhi, music by Bob Dylan and the Beatles, as well as explicitly political texts such as the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on free speech to think about Arendt’s point. Discussions will consider ethics vis-à-vis the political idea of freedom. We will probe different ideas of freedom, explore the relation between narration and acts of freedom (including speech!), trace certain contradictions between freedom and violence, and pose a number of questions about this complex principle. What is the relation between the idea of freedom and action? Does the law guarantee freedom? Can there be freedom when rights are denied based on race, sexual preference, or citizenship status? Is there a relation between sexual and civil rights? What are the possibilities for freedom in an increasingly virtual, digital, and technological world?

As freshmen embarking on a new stage in your education, you will be asked to share and cultivate your own arguments about how you envision freedom and indulge in the faculty of the imagination. One of the premises of the class is that reading literature comparatively (i.e. literature by authors writing in different languages, literature at the crossroads of disciplines and frameworks, literature from different national traditions) is crucial to imagining and ensuring freedom! For instance, as we enter into literary space (the magical realism of Alejo Carpentier’s short novel about the Haitian Revolution entitled The Kingdom of This World, the parables of the Czech-Jewish writer Frantz Kafka, or dramatic scenes from the pay Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes), we will encounter fantasies, myths, and figures that both question restrictive laws enacted in the name of freedom and free our imaginations to new possibilities.

##### Semester Description
Content: The trial and execution of Socrates is usually considered the founding drama of philosophy in the West: In 399 B.C. the Athenians convicted the philosopher Socrates on charges of “impiety” and sentenced him to death.  This course will investigate how and why the Athenians, founders of the first and most radically democratic state in history, were persuaded to execute Socrates, usually considered the founding father of European philosophy. How did philosophy become the enemy of democracy? To answer this question, we will analyze this legendary trial from every angle through close readings of the primary ancient sources – the works of Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes and the Sophists.  And we will learn how to analyze them by reading Aristotle’s account of the art of rhetoric: rhetoric teaches us how to do things with words, how any discourse – philosophical, legal, political, literary, dramatic, cinematic, commercial or pornographic – acts upon our minds; how it succeeds or fails, as well as what it says. Students will learn how to read and explicate these very different ancient texts in their original contexts and how to assess their value for contemporary audiences. If time allows we will compare the rhetorical strategies of actual trials (e.g. Socrates’) to those of literary trials (e.g. Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice). The seminar will conclude with each student defending their vote to acquit or convict Socrates of the original charges. (This seminar is designed for freshman interested in literature, philosophy or classics).

##### Semester Description
Content: Microeconomics is the study of rational choice in a world of scarce resources. It examines how buyers and sellers, consumers and producers, make decisions about the allocation of resources in a capitalistic economic system. This course covers how a market system determines the "prices" of goods and services, the "prices" of factors of production and the incomes of individuals and families. Microeconomics tools will be used to explore a wide range of economic issues such as: Are monopolies bad? What will it take to make business in the United States more competitive in a global economy? Are minimum wage laws and rent controls good for society?

##### Semester Description
Content: ECS 190: Exposed: Environmental Influences and How They Shape Us

Throughout our lives we are exposed. We are exposed to environments. We are exposed to toxins. We are exposed to culture. We are exposed to contexts. What we are exposed to shapes our risk factors for disease. It shapes our behavior. It shapes our identity. It shapes the way we interpret our world. It can even shape the ways our genes express themselves. In this course, students will have a chance to learn about and explore for themselves the ways in which we are all exposed and how this exposure shapes our identity. Two things make this course unique: First, students will work in groups to design their own research question and to conduct their own research--on any topic (from how people interact on campus to how proteins interact in a cell). Second, instead of only one professor, this course will be taught by five teacher-scholars, each of whom approach the questions of exposure and identity from very different fields: psychology, history, religion, philosophy, and neuroscience. While studying the many ways exposure shapes our identities, students will have the opportunity to experience five different fields of study. So, have you been exposed?

Who are you?  How do you face life’s challenges? Can you choose to be the person you are?  In this seminar, we will explore how susceptibility and resilience to factors such as trauma, prejudice, obesity, or immoral behavior consequently shapes individual identity.  

Neuroscience, epigenetics, psychology, philosophy, and religious studies, all examine these kinds of questions in unique yet complementary ways.  Our course will develop a research-oriented approach designed for students ready to face the challenge of grappling with the formation of identity. The question is, what are you going to do?

##### Semester Description
Content: English 101 is the first course in Emory’s two-semester lower-division composition sequence. A grade of D or higher in this class satisfies the first-year English writing requirement. The class will give you a foundation for writing in your own field in later coursework by deepening your understanding of style, audience, and genre. As well as writing two traditional research essays, you will learn to write within the conventions of internet discourses and steward your online presence through the creation of a personal website and digital portfolio. 

This section will focus on hobbies, broadly defined as recreational activities that form an important part of our leisure time. We’ll explore how communities (particularly online communities) form around hobbies and how hobbies shape the way we think about ourselves and others. We will look at excerpts from a number of other texts relevant to themes of self-cultivation. These texts will include Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, Epictetus’ Handbook, Thomas Hilton’s Ladder of Perfection, St. Ignatius’ Spiritual Exercises, and Renée Descartes’ Meditations. We will also look at web publications relevant to the theme of modern geek selfhood from authors such as Neal Stephenson, Allie Brosh (hyperboleandahalf), and Randall Munroe (xkcd). 

This course will culminate in a digital portfolio that you can add to throughout your time at Emory. As part of this portfolio, you will build a website that showcases the work you do for this class: a hypertext that explores an aspect of a hobby’s community of practice. You will also write two research essays informed by our course readings on the care of the self. Throughout the course you will practice strategies for generating, revising, editing, and proofreading your texts. By the end of the course, you should be able to identify different rhetorical situations and choose the best way to respond to them by thinking critically and communicating your ideas effectively.

##### Semester Description
Content:  In recent years, “crisis” has become a household word. At every turn we find ourselves confronted by ecological, fiscal, humanitarian, political, and moral crises (to name just a few), many of which, on consideration, begin to bleed strangely into one another. In this course, we will explore the rhetoric of crisis by asking how we determine we are in a state of crisis and how various uses of language and media attempt to represent, instigate, or confirm a sense of crisis. In examining and participating in these rhetorical issues across a range of topics and media, we will learn how to articulate sophisticated and effective responses by generating and curating content according to disciplinary standards and the needs of our audiences.

Particulars: Students will learn to use writing as a versatile tool for inquiring, learning, thinking, and communicating. By the end of the course, students will be able to purposefully respond to the needs of different audiences by using appropriate conventions of genre and style. Students will additionally understand how to build flexible strategies for breaking down a writing assignment into a series of manageable tasks in which they integrate their own ideas with the ideas of others.

In this class, we will be exploring the intersection of self-writing, social contexts, and digital self-publication. Students will produce two auto ethnographic works in hypertext format, a short film, a comic strip, and some written reflections.  All participants will publish most of their work to a digital portfolio that they can keep, maintain, and re-purpose after the class is over.

##### Semester Description
Content: “Disability is not the story of someone else. It is our story, the story of someone we love, the story of who we are or may become, and it is undoubtedly the story of our nation. It is, quite simply, the American story in all of its complexities.”

\--Kim Nielsen, A Disability History of the United States

By now it has become somewhat commonplace to recognize the ways that race, gender, sexuality, and/or class have structured and permeated American life. But it remains rare for anyone to pay critical attention to the way that disability has structured and permeated all areas of American life and culture, as Kim Nielsen suggests in the quote above. In this intensive first-year writing course we will take this inattention as an opportunity not only to collectively hone our writing skills on an intriguing though often overlooked issue, but also to make an actual contribution to the small but growing body of research about it. As such, we will explore the various modes of composing (writing as well as multi-modal modes that include visual, video, audio, etc.) and the issues of audience, purpose, revision, persuasion, self-assessment etc. that should always attend our compositions while simultaneously producing texts that explore how the presence of disability impacts various sectors of American life including language, culture, and space. As such, all participants will publish most of their work in this course digitally, on both a class website and in a digital portfolio housed on their own personal website as part of the Domain of One’s Own Initiative.  

####Texts:  
All texts for this course will be available online and will represent a wide variety of modes, genres, and disciplines. Expect to encounter everything from the personal writings of people with disabilities to researched essays, documentaries and podcasts about disability-related issues in American life. 

##### Particulars:  
Students can expect to compose and revise three main projects, all of which will be digitally published. These projects will each involve some combination of a formal paper (two 3-4 page papers and one 7-8 page paper), supporting documents (annotated bibliography, descriptive map annotations, research exercises, etc.), a multimodal digital production, and in-class presentation. Students will also be responsible for composing frequent self-assessments of their work throughout the semester and producing a final digital portfolio that collects and assesses their whole semester’s worth of creations.

##### Semester Description
Content:  What is memory? Unless we do active work ourselves, memory cannot happen.  In this course we will “tell stories,” using the framework of memory—from the personal to the collective—as our guide.  Becoming storytellers, we will reflect on both individual memories and collective memories of historical traumas, like Slavery, the Holocaust, and the AIDS pandemic, through the act of composition.  Generally, the course has two main sections.  In the first unit, we will compose via personal memory, writing and investigating the self and memory in the digital “social network” world.  In the second half, we will move to a broader discussion of cultural (or collective) memorial practices and sites. We will compose three main papers: 1) a personal memoir, 2) a proposal for a cultural memorial, and 3) a research paper based upon our cultural memorial proposals.  We will also blog post regularly as well as compose in various digital medias.  We will work to actively engage in understanding how we remember and memorialize.  We will view one film as well as many other artistic texts—from sculpture to graphic novels to textiles.  Readings will draw from various thinkers of memory.

##### Semester Description
Content:  What is a drug?  How do we understand the relationship between society and the drug?  This section of composition and rhetoric will focus on rhetorical strategies and multimodal composition, by focusing on “the drug” as a cultural artifact that can be described in many different ways.  Each section of this course will focus on “drugs” and their representations as they are situated in different rhetorical communities. We will explore contrasting conversations and descriptive tactics in order to understand the relationship of drugs to their social, political, and rhetorical contexts.   Finally, we will attempt to understand and describe the ways in which these social, political and rhetorical contexts affect how we understand the meaning of the word “drug”? We will read poetry, non-fiction, and essays, as well as watching short videos and a film.  The assignments will include 1 three page paper, 2 five page papers, and a research design project.  This course meets the college writing requirement for first years.  This requirement may be met with a grade of D or above.

##### Semester Description
Content: Science Fiction has often been distinguished from other “speculative” genres by its attention to the context-specific norms, values, and mores of the age in which it is written. Thus, even as science fiction novels create new worlds that readers must struggle to understand, we will consider how these “other worlds” comment on our own. Together we will attempt to answer the following questions: What is Science Fiction? How is the “strange” and the “unknown” configured? What are the narrative conventions and modes for thinking through the otherworldly? How do writers use the socio-historical context to shape the “strange” and “other?” Although we will begin with the “pulp” science fiction stories of the 1930s, we will specifically focus on American Science Fiction texts ranging from 1960 to the present. We will explore literature and film primarily, but we will also look into music and images to see ways of conceiving “strangeness.”

The goal of this course is for you to improve your critical thinking skills through writing and close reading. Through our attention to the context of the writers and the science fiction genre, you should be able to recognize that writing is situated and context driven, informed by the societies and communities in which it is produced. We will question who is the speaker? What is the context in which the work was written? How is the “other” represented? How about the Self? Who is the audience? As we explore other worlds, you too will learn to pay attention to your own world and your own perspective while engaging in conversations with others (classmates, scholars, authors, and, we hope, alien friends).

##### Semester Description
Content: “Laugh it up fuzz ball.” “Hey, wise guy!”What does comedy do rhetorically and why might it be useful in getting a point across? In this course we will use comedy and comic theory to explore the basics of composition. This course will ask, “How does comedy highlight key tenets of rhetoric and composition-- like audience, purpose, and argument-- and, integrally, how can we use comedy to compose effectively?” Students will be exposed to a variety of theories of comedy (incongruity, superiority and relief) in order to highlight the importance of form when writing. They will also be encouraged to bring in their own examples of comedy and to analyze those examples alongside those provided in class. This course will fulfill writing requirements with a little fun, lot of laughs and, hopefully, will encourage students to take comedy seriously as a mode of composition.

This course will require students to complete 2 midterms assignments (one college length research essay, one creative/critical project) and a creative/critical final project.  

####Texts: 

1. 	  Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing, Bedford St. Martin’s,

##### Semester Description
Content: To write about conflict—and humanitarian work in the midst of conflict—is to encounter tough aesthetic, ethical, and political dilemmas. Delving into these dilemmas, this course will consider recent fiction, graphic storytelling, film, and poetry that engages with historical conflicts in Africa and South Asia. We will read these literary texts alongside critical essays on human rights and humanitarianism. What strategies do writers use, we will ask, when faced with humanitarian catastrophe? How might their work challenge Western assumptions about the so-called Third World? Can writers actually help to bring about justice in the wake of violence?

As you respond to what you read, this writing-intensive course will enable you to understand the conventions of literary analysis and develop as a college-level writer. Emphasizing the value of rewriting, the course will ask you to contribute to a course blog, participate in writing workshops with your classmates, and revise drafts of your own work. The final course project will involve researching and writing about an ongoing humanitarian crisis or conflict.

##### Semester Description
Content:In English 181.009 we will we do our part to help obstruct the impending environmental crisis via the analysis and production of environmental literature. To this end, we will read and write literature that troubles easy distinctions between insides and outsides to offer a broad range of eco-ethical possibilities. In order to produce your own individual, environmental projects, you will engage with texts from multiple genres, historical periods, and regions in which humans represent themselves and the natural world. The self-writing nature is at the heart of this course because the investigation and production of environmental literature can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of self-nature relations. A more nuanced understanding of self-nature relations is a necessary launching point from which each of us can redress global climate change, rapid extinction of animal species, resource exploitation, and global degradation. 

Assignments:  English 181.009 meets the changing needs of Emory students and the environment through multimodal projects and digital composition. Multimodal production is especially important to environmental writing so student-produced texts, at all stages of the collaborative process, do not end-up as just more dead narratives about humans in the wilderness.  The multimodal texts required for successful completion of ENG 181 are as follows: a digital portfolio and personal site; an argument on a film with video clips and hyperlink as textual evidence; a power-point presentation with a corresponding sermon filmed for the website; and a photo-shop activity in which students write themselves into early modern hypertexts. For the final project, students will alter their mass produced copies of Thoreau’s Walden into individual art books, and document the alterations with video and text their websites.

##### Major Texts:
Cronan, William ed. Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature; Benjamin, Walter. "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction;" Leopold, Aldo. A Sand County Almanac: Essays on Conservation; Lopez, Barry and Robin Eschner. Apologia; Middleton, Thomas. The Owl’s Almanac; Shakespeare, William, The History of King Lear; Spenser, Edmund. “The Shepherd’s Calendar,” and Wall-E.

##### Semester Description
Content: ENG 181-012 is designed to help students develop as reflective, critical, effective, and creative readers and writers. While the city is our theme, the primary focus of the class will be on the craft of reading and writing, pursuits which extend far beyond any topic or even discipline. Like the cities we will be thinking about throughout the semester, the field of writing is diverse, heterogeneous, and unpredictable. The goal of the class is to explore that strange terrain together, and hopefully emerge at the end of semester more capable and confident writers and readers. In addition to some helpful texts on reading and writing about literature, the course will include selections of short fiction, poetry, and film interested in the city and its inhabitants, from Edgar Allen Poe to film noir. Along the way, we’ll tackle a range of critical writing assignments, and try our hand at a few creative projects as well. Writing is hard, and even the most practiced writers run into trouble from time to time. Working together in a workshop setting, we’ll confront each of those obstacles together, and maybe even have a little fun!

Assignments: Students in ENG 181-012 will complete a range of written assignments critical to the study of literature and academic work more broadly, including a short close reading assignment, a literary analysis, an annotated bibliography, and a research paper. The course will also include a number of brief creative assignments, in which students will get a chance to imagine the city themselves. The only required text for purchase will be Reading and Writing About Literature: A Portable Guide (3rd Ed.), edited by Janet E. Gardner.

##### Semester Description
Content: William Blake (1757-1827) is an unusual figure, isolated and impoverished in his own time, widely known, admired and imitated in ours.  He was a poet of great originality, a painter and engraver of startling imagination; he saw himself as a prophet squarely in the tradition of the prophets of the Bible.

He was a mystic who once saw the face of God outside his window and regularly took dictation from angels—or so he said.  He was also a political radical, looking to the American and French Revolutions  to bring liberty to a British social order dominated by the powerful.

Blake’s verbal and visual art have been widely anthologized and reproduced, his example often followed by experimental artists, for example, by the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and the singer and song-writer Jim Morrison of The Doors.   In this course we will examine at length Blake’s poetry and prose, his painting and engraving, his prophetic stance toward “the Eternals,” as he called them, and his political stance toward the revolutionary events of his own time.  We will consider the social and cultural context in which Blake lived and worked, as well as the sources of his most challenging ideas.  And we will look at the impact his work has had on some of the “Children of the future age” who have taken up his challenge to change the human condition through the transformative power of art.

We are fortunate to be able to use some excellent editions and reproductions of Blake’s art:  the comprehensive Norton Critical Edition, Blake’s Poetry and Designs, ed. Mary Lynn Johnson and John E. Grant;  a recent historical novel, Burning Bright by Tracy Chevalier, in which Blake plays an important role; a beautiful facsimile edition of Blake’s “illuminated book,” Songs of Innocence and of Experience, from the Tate Gallery; and a state-of-the-art web site,  the Blake Archive (www.blakearchive.org), supported by the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina, which is close to providing reproductions and analytic apparatus for all of Blake’s surviving illuminated books and illustrations.  We will also consult some recent biographies and a sampling of the most insightful critical commentary and interpretation of his diverse oeuvre.  The seminar will offer an interdisciplinary approach to an artist and thinker who crossed many disciplines in the course of his unusual career.

##### Semester Description
Content:  This course will introduce you to contemporary American literature, written from the margins, by Asian American women writers with the goal of examining nation, culture, ethnicity, family. As you read, ask yourself, What are the major characters feeling? How do we know what they are feeling? What seems familiar and recognizable? What seems alien to your experience? If you could give these characters any advice, what would it be? Finally, (and this is a big one), What do you think it means to be American? What is the content of American-ness? You will be writing in class almost every day. These short exercises will serve two purposes; they will form the foundation of your formal, graded writing; they will encourage you to engage closely with the material read and discussed in class that day; they will give you source material for the final draft; they will enhance your ability to write spontaneously and so gradually improve your skills. Additionally, at the end of every class, you will prepare a list of review questions in preparation for the quiz, and generate at least one writing topic.

very semester. Freshmen only. Through readings on variable topics, frequent writing assignments, and in-class discussions, the seminar emphasizes reasoned discourse and intellectual community. Does not satisfy first-year writing requirement.

##### Semester Description
Content:  This course is devoted to fiction that asks urgent questions about the relations of humans to the natural world and to the idea of “nature.”  What are the lines separating human from animal, human from machine, and technology from nature?  What are the consequences of tinkering with natural systems?  What are the connections among scientific progress, profit, and harm? We’ll be pairing two sets of novels that pose bold ethical questions that reverberate across the centuries.  The first pair is Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), which imagines a nightmare scenario of bioengineering, and Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake (2003), which runs wild with Shelley’s scenario in a world collapsing under global warming.  The second set starts with Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), which chronicles an epic (and mad) quest to master the deep in service of an emerging global capitalist industry; it concludes with Richard Powers’s Gain (1998), which movingly dramatizes the risks to health and environment that grow from unchecked corporate expansion.   We will also give considerable attention to criticism of these works and to the processes of literary interpretation, essay writing, and revision.

##### Semester Description
Content: A freshman-only workshop for students who have had little or no experience in creative writing. Not a prerequisite for other courses in the program. The course will take an in-depth look at poems that seek to engage and document our stories--those histories both public and private, real and imagined. We will discuss the ways that some poets have used personal and public history in their work, define some strategies for using information gathered from our research, and begin writing some poems that engage those histories to which we have some connection. In all of this, we will focus on cultivating the craft of poetry with particular emphasis on what makes a poem work--metaphor, image, musicality, voice, etc. We will work to develop the critical language necessary for discussing each other's work and for critically approaching our own poems during the important process of revision. Students should budget for photocopying.

##### Semester Description
An opportunity to generate new work while helping to engender in one another new ideas about writing.  As there is a profound relationship between reading poetry and writing it, we will read, discuss, and even recite the work of several poets whose example might lead us to a further honing of our craft.  In each workshop, we will read and discuss students’ poems in order to examine the relationships between the poet's intentions and ideas and the phrases and images used to embody them.  As we explore the genre of poetry in the United States, students will learn the meanings and uses of poetic terms, as well as the work of major American poets. As poetry always has, this course deals with material meant for mature audiences and adult discussion.  Students who do not wish to think or study, should reconsider their enrollment in this one.  Students should budget for photocopying.

##### Semester Description
Content:  An introduction to the study and practice of poetry.  This workshop will be an opportunity for students to generate new work while being placed in an assortment of poetic contexts.  Students will be challenged to interrogate, inhabit, and deploy the elements of language that form and in effect define the medium of poetry—rhetorical figures, schemes, tropes, personae, sound effects, structure, etc.—and, through such engagement, to develop a deeper understanding of poetic technique and possibility.  Workshop participants will write and revise their own poems as well as read and discuss the work of peers and predecessors with consistent sensitivity, deliberation, and acuity.  The development and exercise of critical response skills and vocabulary will be essential, as each class session will be divided between workshop and a critical consideration of poems and/or ideas about poetry.  Students will be responsible for at least one analytical presentation and for occasional critical and reflective writings over the course of the semester.  In short, we will be exploring how poems work, and using that knowledge to compose and revise new poems. Students should budget for printing and/or photocopying.

ENGCW 271W 01P will be taught by Malachi Black, the 2013-2015 Creative Writing Fellow in Poetry. Malachi Black is the author of Storm Toward Morning, forthcoming from Copper Canyon Press, and two limited edition chapbooks:  Quarantine (Argos Books, 2012) and Echolocation (Float Press, 2010).

##### Semester Description
Content: This course introduces students to the critical reading and writing of literary fiction. Some scholars suggest it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become a proficient writer, and while students won’t get that much experience in this course, they will certainly get a lot of practice writing. Students will begin by writing short creative exercises that explore the basic elements of craft, especially character development, plot, dialogue, setting, and point of view. Students will then progress to writing a minimum of 15 pages of completed fiction, which will be critiqued in a workshop setting and revised during finals week. One of the best ways to learn to write well, other than practicing the writing itself, is to learn to read with the eyes of a writer, examining the way published stories work and the choices the writers made. Therefore, every week students will also read and discuss one or more published stories. This course will prepare students for intermediate and advanced workshops in fiction. Students should budget for photocopying.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course introduces the beginning writer to the reading and writing of literary fiction. Through a close, critical examination of the elements of the short form—imagery, voice, story, setting, and dialogue—students will become more aware to the ingredients that go into a successful (or unsuccessful) piece of prose. Students will write one short story of their own, which their fellow classmates will discuss and critique in a supportive, constructive workshop environment. A rigorous, thoughtful revision is expected. Students will turn in a copy of their revisions during the final week of class. This course prepares students for intermediate and advanced workshops in fiction. Students should budget for photocopying.

##### Semester Description
Content: This freshman seminar is an introduction to the Piedmont physiographic province with an emphasis on discovering what our relationship is to this place.   Using Aldo Leopold’s Land Ethic as a focus of discussion, we will “enlarge the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.”  We will focus on how to read the landscape in order to decipher its history and will study how Southeastern ecosystems function as protected lands, from urban green spaces to wilderness areas.  Students will develop an understanding of the ways in which healthy, functioning ecosystems support human health and wellbeing as well as how local and broad-scale human influences impact the very ecosystems that sustain us. Assessment will include participation in discussion, presentations, in-class assignments, as well as field journals and small-scale restoration and field projects.

##### Catalog Description 
Explores various topics in Film Studies or Media Studies. When taught as Introduction to Film, this course fulfills a core requirement of the Film Studies major and minor. When taught as a media studies class, this course counts towards the Media Studies minor. Weekly screenings required.

##### Semester Description
Content: This class will help introduce you to ways of “reading” and analyzing film, and by extension, other visual media, so that you can be a more informed and critical viewer. During the first half of the semester, we will learn the basic techniques of film form and style. For the remainder of the course, we will discuss these techniques as they relate to issues of critical analysis (cultural criticism, genre, ideology) in both Hollywood narrative cinema and non-Hollywood/alternative cinemas.

The class goals are as follows:

 1. To enhance your visual and auditory awareness and literacy.
 2.    To offer you a methodology for “reading” and understanding cinematic images.
 3.    To give you a sense of how film language has evolved throughout history and how different national cinemas have used images to achieve varying goals (artistic, political, economic).
 4.    To equip you with the vocabulary to confidently order your responses to images through verbal and written communication. 

Students are expected to be open-minded and active participants in class discussions and should be prepared to think, write, and speak critically and analytically about film art and culture from a broad range of national cinemas and production contexts.

Fall, Summer (Vienna). The first of the two-course sequence (101-102) that introduces students to reading, writing, speaking, and understanding the German language through an exploration of the roles and group affiliations that contribute to the identity of young adults in the United States and the German-speaking world. 

##### Semester Description
Content: Reflecting the German Studies Department's efforts to integrate the study of content and language at all levels of the curriculum, German 101 is the first of the two-course sequence that explores the roles and group affiliations that contribute to the identity formation of young adults in the United States and the German-speaking world. Specifically, students will examine the following three roles in 101, devoting 4-5 weeks to each: The young adult as (1) a student; (2) a hobbyist; and (3) a family member. Students will use a textbook and supplemental materials to acquire the language necessary to communicate meaningfully about each topic. Integrated into the four regularly scheduled class sessions is one additional practice session a week that focuses on using newly learned concepts in conversational settings. Through this process of examining identity formation, students in this course and in its sequel, German 102, will be introduced to the principles of speaking, writing, reading, and understanding German and to life in German-speaking countries.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course is part of Emory College’s Voluntary Core Curriculum.  Certain great books have been immensely influential across the centuries, and continue to influence the way we think, act, and understand ourselves today. Major themes of the course are religion (sections from the Bible), history (Herodotus, Julius Caesar, Tacitus), politics (Machiavelli), economics (Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John M. Keynes), biology (Charles Darwin) and psychology (Sigmund Freud). Students will be encouraged to read critically, not reverently, and to take these authors’ ideas as the starting point for debate.

Three class meetings each week.  One midterm, one final, and three short papers.  Members of this course will also be required to attend the Emory Williams endowed lectures.  These lectures, on a variety of topics related to the Great Books, are held on Wednesday afternoons four or five times per semester.

##### Semester Description
Content:  Writing Memory focuses on human memory and personal narrative.  The goals of the course are two-fold.  First, through course readings and discussion we will learn about the nature and types of memory.  We will study the biology of memory through a few important scientific works, with particular attention to brain structures such as the hippocampus and the amygdala and the roles memory may play in human evolution.  We will also learn about the different types of memory, such as implicit and explicit memory, autobiographical memory, and so on.  This will lead to discussions on some of the debates about memory that have unfolded over the past three decades.  The second goal of the course centers the writing of personal history.  Students will research, write about and discuss different aspects of their memory alongside readings and discussions of various literary memoirs.  In doing so they will become historians of their past.

##### Semester Description
Content:  Life in the East European Jewish shtetl was not all about prayer and dairy farming; there was also interfaith romance, runaway brides, and homosexual attraction.  This seminar will explore gender and sexuality in prewar Eastern Europe society and culture, and ask how modernity affected marriage, love, and the Jewish family.  In probing gender and sexual identities in Ashkenazi and Yiddish culture, we will critically reassess the shtetl mythology of prewar Eastern Europe and the trope of the East European Jewish family as the bulwark of tradition against the encroachments of modernity.  Topics of study include: the East European Jewish Enlightenment and the feminized Jewish man; Jewish women and the mass politics of Zionism, socialism and revolution; cross-dressing and transgendered dreams in Yiddish fiction; and female converts and their anxious Jewish families.  We will pair our readings in history and literature with films and contemporary media coverage of sexual politics in the new “shtetls” of Israel and America.  Films include: Yentl, Fiddler on the Roof, Trembling before God, and The Dybbuk.  Seminar titles include: “The Real Jewish Housewives of Vilna: Extramarital Affairs and Single Motherhood”; “Hasidism, the Heder, and Homo-eroticism”; and “The Sexual Politics of Language and Education in Traditional Societies”.  Together, we will learn how to “read” history from the margins, and use provocative texts and arguments to better understand historical change even in times and places that seem the most resistant to it.

No prior knowledge of the subject matter is assumed.  All readings are in English.

##### Catalog Description 
Examines major themes in European history during the modern era, roughly mid-seventeenth century to the present; special attention to conflicts in economic, political, social, and intellectual life.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course offers a broad survey of modern European history from the age of Religious wars until the present.  It follows the history of European societies from the “old regime” before the French Revolution, through revolutions, wars, massive economic and social changes to the world of heavy industry and urban life, nation states, imperialism, globalization, mass politics, leisure and culture, the rise and fall of fascism, National Socialism and Communism, the Holocaust, and the division of Europe after 1945.  While we will cover major events, cultural trends, and big personalities such as the French Revolution, Enlightenment, and Napoleon, we will pay close attention to factors such as class, gender, and religion, and ask how ordinary people experienced the political, economic, social, and cultural revolutions of modern European society.  Through lecture and discussion, original sources and textbook, this course seeks to deepen students’ understanding of the stellar rise, implosion, and rebirth of modern Europe over the past three centuries.

It will explore the causes and consequences of this historical trajectory with the emphasis on the West, rather than the world, though historical events in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be discussed in the context of their interactions with the West.  In other words, this is not a “world history” course but a history of the West in the world. Topics such as colonization, art and intellectual history, the World Wars, and globalization will be discussed in the context of the West as a worldwide power. This is a general education course and no prior knowledge is assumed, but having completed the course, students will be expected to be able to discuss and contextualize primary sources clearly and skillfully using the historical method.

##### Semester Description
Content:Hollywood’s romantized portrayal has greatly influenced American popular understanding of the Sicilian mafia.  But what is the real mafia like? Italians have used the medium of film to address this very question, raising awareness about the harsh reality of life in the mafia and the ways in which the “octopus” reaches into every aspect of Italian politics and society.  This course will examine representations of the mob in Italian film while at the same time tracing the history of organized crime in Italy, focusing particularly on the Sicilian mafia.  Some of the films we will screen include: The Day of the Owl, Mafioso, and Gamorrah.  Students will be encouraged to think critically about representations of Sicily and Sicilians, the fight against the mafia, the exportation of the mob to the United States, and the use of both fiction and non-fiction narrative in political and social struggle.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course is an introduction to the history of East Asia with a focus on how East Asian societies interacted with each other and with the wider world. It begins around 1500 and starts by examining Japan and China's maritime empires and the 15th century expeditions of the Chinese explorer Zheng He.  We will also examine East Asia's modernizing reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries from a transnational perspective, as reformers in Japan, China and Korea discussed how to implement European models of social and governmental organization during an era when such models were being promoted as universal. Debates about reform continue to this day, and we will again emphasize the historical context of, for example, Chinese cynicism about universal human rights.

##### Semester Description
Content:  Where did chiropractors, graham crackers, and Dr. Oz come from? They’re all products of a uniquely American view of what it takes to pursue—and achieve—good health. This class will explore the history of that pursuit from colonial times to the present. We’ll read individual philosophies of health from Thomas Jefferson to “Dr. Oz,” and from Sylvester Graham (yes, of graham cracker fame)to John Harvey Kellogg. We’ll uncover the emergence of competing health practices, including chiropractic, homeopathy, botanical medicine, and “orthodox” medicine. We’ll study the histories of a variety of health practitioners, from midwives to civil war surgeons to health reformers. We’ll also look at the emergence of the U.S.’s most venerable institutions of health and the long struggle to provide health care for all. Today’s healthcare priorities and medical preoccupations, as we’ll see, are deeply rooted in American history, and they’re tightly linked to our nation’s long-standing debates over the size of government, the definition of liberty, the meaning of oppression, and more.

##### Semester Description
Content: In only twelve years, Nazi Germany established a strict dictatorship that persecuted its political and racial enemies, rewarded those who complied with its political and racial vision, brought war to Europe and the world, and committed the crimes collectively known as the Holocaust. The shock-waves of this regime extend to the present day. References to Hitler and the Nazis are ubiquitous in political rhetoric and popular culture, and academic scholarship reflects upon this outburst of violence in ever changing ways.

This course offers a comprehensive overview of the origins, development, and outcomes of National Socialism. It covers the rise of the Nazi party, the establishment of the dictatorship, the emergence of the racial state, the life of Jews and social outsiders in Nazi Germany, the road to war, resistance to the Nazis, the role of the universities, daily life in Nazi Germany including sports, film, and radio, gender roles as well sexual identity under the Nazis, and the crimes of euthanasia and the Holocaust.

This introductory level course is designed for students without any prior knowledge of German history, the history of National Socialism and World War II. It will focus on the reading of primary sources (original documents from the time period), combined with lectures and discussion. The course does not fulfill the post-freshman writing requirement.

##### Semester Description
Content: his course is designed to examine the ways in which the British colonization of India led to dramatic cultural, societal, legal, and intellectual shifts.  In seeking to exert order over their colonial possessions and control over their colonial subjects, British colonial officials indelibly altered India.  Many of the assumptions and institutional practices adopted during the colonial period have helped to shape modern South Asia in significant ways.  This survey will begin in the late eighteenth century and conclude in the decades directly following Indian independence.  As a course that serves a General Education Requirement (HSC), it is not intended to be a preparation course for later history courses, nor does it presume that students have knowledge of the topic.

##### Semester Description
Content:  This course will examine the period from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s, often called the “Long Sixties.”  Primarily through the analysis of written primary sources, but also of films and music, we will consider how the interactions between politics and social movements shaped the end of the American Cold War consensus.

For example, we will consider how Stanley Kubrick’s Doctor Strangelove was shaped by cultural and diplomatic concerns about nuclear buildup during the Cold War.  We will examine the Vietnam War from the perspective of Lyndon Johnson’s administration, as well as that of soldiers and the broader American public.  We will discuss the cultural impact of the Civil Rights Movement, the New Left, Second Wave Feminism, and various “liberation” movements, also examining conservatism not simply as a backlash against these movements, but as a social movement in its own right.

##### Semester Description
Content: Latin American Urban History takes a look at the history of the continent from a multidisciplinary approach. This allows us to look at the city as something more than a population center. The course studies the urban as a place for the creation of popular culture, class and race relations and transformation, literature and city planning. The urban is contrasted and tied to rural spaces, the stereotypical image of Latin America, and allows us to see the region in a new light.

This course looks at the history of Latin America from the pre-Conquest period to the Twentieth-Century using a multidisciplinary approach. Our study is not merely the cities, but a continental history that uses urban centers as both object of study and vehicles for understanding processes and actors. We follow historical developments in the continent through the vantage point of its urban centers through a multiplicity of sources: photography and cartography share the scene with literature, film, and colonial decrees. The “country” or the “rural world” – complex entities more imagined than real – are used as counterpoints: the urban and the rural share an easy relationship of dependency and mistrust. As the course advances, we will deconstruct the concept of the city itself, and particularly its Latin American incarnation, from Tenochtitlan to the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.

Notes re: grading:  Regardless of the percentages, students must reach passing grades in class participation, the research paper, and the final exam in order to pass the course.  Grading is not based on a curve system.

##### Semester Description
Content: The First World War was one of the most cataclysmic and transformative events of modern history, in Europe and worldwide.  In both the war’s causes and its course it touched deeply upon fundamental structures of European society and political culture.  It opened up the age of total war, with effects upon all aspects of life.  In this class we will study the First World War in this broad sense, from the perspectives of social and cultural as well as military and political history.  We will consider the experience of the war by soldiers and civilians, its representation in visual and written forms, the strains upon gender roles for men and women, the role of colonial troops and the campaigns outside Europe, the evolving nature of the fighting and the role of technology, and the changes wrought in social and political relations during the war and in its immediate aftermath, with the revolutionary collapse of four empires.  If knowledge of the twentieth century is essential to understanding the twenty-first, studying the history of the First World War is indispensable to both.

##### Semester Description
Content: Ancient Kingdoms, Modern States

From piracy in the Somali Puntland to post-genocide politics in Rwanda to poachers in the game parks of Tanzania, eastern African stories frequently grab international headlines.  How do we make sense of these brief and often troubling snapshots of African life?  How do we move toward a more nuanced understanding of the nature of political community, the engines of social change, and the challenges of economic development?  How can we reconcile narratives of intense crisis with the unremarkable successes of everyday life? 

In this course, students will gain perspective on modern East Africa through an exploration of the region’s history from 1500 to the present day.  Expanding beyond the traditional “core” nations of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, we will also connect with the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes, the Zambesi Basin, and the Indian Ocean world.  Our approach will emphasize the diverse factors that have influenced local and transnational dynamics within East Africa, such as environmental change, ethnic identity, epidemic disease, gender, migration, trade, and land tenure.  We will also situate the region as a global crossroads of goods, people, and ideas and use its history to understand Africa’s changing place in the world.  Chronologically, case studies will range from the ancient kingdoms of the Western Rift Valley to the sprawling modern cities of Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.  Our materials will draw upon history, anthropology, archaeology, geography, and literature.

####Semester Description:##
The first half of this lecture course surveys the historical, ideological, and social origins of the conflict from the 1880s to 1949. Focus is placed on the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, socio-economic history of the area, the origins and development of Zionism, regional Arab responses, and great power imperial interests. How and why did the Zionists succeed and the Arabs did not? Local, regional, and international politics from 1914 to 1949 are discussed in detail. The second half of the course focuses on the emergence of Israel and the Palestinian refugee issue, Arab politics, Middle Eastern wars, the Israeli quest for normalization, and the origins and fragmentation of Palestinian nationalism.  A core of the course reviews the diplomatic successes and failures in seeking the conflict’s resolution, and especially the role played by the United States.  End of semester topics include a discussion of US foreign policy to the region, Iran, the US-Israeli relationship, the so-called ‘Arab Spring,’ and an evaluation of the prospects for the conflict’s resolution.   Reading, analyzing, and evaluating key documents related to the conflict's history are central features of the course.

##### Semester Description
Content: William Blake (1757-1827) is an unusual figure, isolated and impoverished in his own time, widely known, admired and imitated in ours.  He was a poet of great originality, a painter and engraver of startling imagination; he saw himself as a prophet squarely in the tradition of the prophets of the Bible.

He was a mystic who once saw the face of God outside his window and regularly took dictation from angels—or so he said.  He was also a political radical, looking to the American and French Revolutions  to bring liberty to a British social order dominated by the powerful.

Blake’s verbal and visual art have been widely anthologized and reproduced, his example often followed by experimental artists, for example, by the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and the singer and song-writer Jim Morrison of The Doors.   In this course we will examine at length Blake’s poetry and prose, his painting and engraving, his prophetic stance toward “the Eternals,” as he called them, and his political stance toward the revolutionary events of his own time.  We will consider the social and cultural context in which Blake lived and worked, as well as the sources of his most challenging ideas.  And we will look at the impact his work has had on some of the “Children of the future age” who have taken up his challenge to change the human condition through the transformative power of art.

We are fortunate to be able to use some excellent editions and reproductions of Blake’s art:  the comprehensive Norton Critical Edition, Blake’s Poetry and Designs, ed. Mary Lynn Johnson and John E. Grant;  a recent historical novel, Burning Bright by Tracy Chevalier, in which Blake plays an important role; a beautiful facsimile edition of Blake’s “illuminated book,” Songs of Innocence and of Experience, from the Tate Gallery; and a state-of-the-art web site,  the Blake Archive (www.blakearchive.org), supported by the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina, which is close to providing reproductions and analytic apparatus for all of Blake’s surviving illuminated books and illustrations.  We will also consult some recent biographies and a sampling of the most insightful critical commentary and interpretation of his diverse oeuvre.  The seminar will offer an interdisciplinary approach to an artist and thinker who crossed many disciplines in the course of his unusual career.

##### Catalog Descriptions:
Fall semester. Based on the innovative Emory program, IVC: Italian Virtual Class project, this course offers an engaging and interactive approach to language learning whereby language is mastered through the systematic full-immersion study of Italian culture. Through the latest technology-facilitated portal of a unique multimedia ebook, focus is on thematically sequential and in-depth studies of Italian, history, literature, art, and folk traditions presented through authentic original on-line live interviews and cultural scenarios, videos, images, and texts. Development of analytical, critical and reasoning skills as well as cross-cultural awareness are emphasized. Higher than norm linguistic and cultural fluency is achieved by the end of the 101-102 sequence.

##### Semester Description
Content: This is the first course of the two semester introductory sequence (Ital 101-Ital 102), which are taught with the new Italian Virtual Class inter-active cultural text. From the first day of class, instruction is in Italian, and students are encouraged to participate actively in the acquisition of integrated language skills. Emphasis will be placed on useful conversation, elementary grammar, and Italian culture; written and oral exercises will be assigned daily to reinforce material presented in class. Students will be regularly exposed to direct and live cultural footage and interviews conducted in Italy in order to create a coherent and meaningful fusion of language and culture. Attendance is expected both during the four hours of class instruction and at the language lab. When students have successfully completed Italian 101 and 102 they will have the skills necessary to communicate with Italians and Italian speakers both here and in Italy, on at least a practical level. (We highly recommend a semester in Italy on one of our 4 excellent semester and/or a summer on the very popular Emory Summer Studies in Italy program.

Texts: Required IVC textbook plus computer access with Flash Player; the Collins Italian-English Dictionary.

Assessment: 3 tests, bi-weekly quizzes and final exam. The course is especially valuable for students of Art History, English, European History, Film, Music and other Languages and Literatures.

##### Catalog Description 
Designed to engage first-year students in aspects of inquiry and research into areas of Jewish religion, culture, history, or language. Topics will vary.

##### Semester Description
Content: Life in the East European Jewish shtetl was not all about prayer and dairy farming; there was also interfaith romance, runaway brides, and homosexual attraction.  This seminar will explore gender and sexuality in prewar Eastern Europe society and culture, and ask how modernity affected marriage, love, and the Jewish family.  In probing gender and sexual identities in Ashkenazi and Yiddish culture, we will critically reassess the shtetl mythology of prewar Eastern Europe and the trope of the East European Jewish family as the bulwark of tradition against the encroachments of modernity.  Topics of study include: the East European Jewish Enlightenment and the feminized Jewish man; Jewish women and the mass politics of Zionism, socialism and revolution; cross-dressing and transgendered dreams in Yiddish fiction; and female converts and their anxious Jewish families.  We will pair our readings in history and literature with films and contemporary media coverage of sexual politics in the new “shtetls” of Israel and America.  Films include: Yentl, Fiddler on the Roof, Trembling before God, and The Dybbuk.  Seminar titles include: “The Real Jewish Housewives of Vilna: Extramarital Affairs and Single Motherhood”; “Hasidism, the Heder, and Homo-eroticism”; and “The Sexual Politics of Language and Education in Traditional Societies”.  Together, we will learn how to “read” history from the margins, and use provocative texts and arguments to better understand historical change even in times and places that seem the most resistant to it.

Particulars:  No prior knowledge of the subject matter is assumed.  All readings are in English.

Fall, spring. An historical examination of the various languages and dialects used in American society and the development of an American identity through language use and language policy.

##### Semester Description
Content:  This course presents a linguistic view of the history, society, and culture of the United States. It discusses the many languages and forms of language that have been used in this country over its history, including standard and nonstandard forms of English, different social and geographical dialects, African American English, creoles, Native American languages, and immigrant languages from Asia and Europe.

Students examine the inherent diversity of these communicative systems both as a form of cultural enrichment and as the basis for socio-political conflict, and also investigate possible solutions to these problems through class discussion and debate. In addition, students study the universal phenomenon of language change and explore how it affects understanding of language behavior.

Note: Even though total enrollment is sixty, 40 spots are reserved for sophomores and freshmen.

##### Catalog Description 
The freshman seminar in linguistics introduces students to basic aspects in linguistics by focusing on specific themes and topics which vary according to the instructor.

##### Semester Description
Content: How many languages are spoken in the world, and why is this a difficult question to answer? What does it mean for two languages to be related? What is linguistics, and to what extent does it actually involve the study of individual languages? We will address these questions and many others as we examine a geographically diverse sample of the world's languages. Students will learn about language families and historical relationships, linguistic typology and language universals, sound and structural features, and writing systems. We will also think critically about language extinction and preservation, the ethical application of fieldwork methods, the connection between language and culture, and the nature of universal grammar. This seminar is appropriate for any student interested in linguistics, language structures, or language relationships.

Content: T    he course is designed to build the laws of probability, statistics and game theory through the models of well known games and sports. Fundamental laws of probability will be developed and applied to games such as poker, blackjack, backgammon, lotteries and more.  Fundamental combinatorial counting techniques will be employed to determine outcomes (permutations and combinations).  Card tricks based on mathematical principles will be demonstrated in order to learn basic ideas of information encoding.  Deeper fundamentals will be introduced using more involved examples. In developing these theories, laws of fair judging can also be investigated.  Games will be employed to develop winning strategies or determine when a win is not possible.
Class participation will be a major component of the course.  Small group learning will also be employed, both for in class experiments and for some assignments. Students will be encouraged to work together in class to test experiments and raise conjectures. They will present their ideas to the rest of class. General writing techniques will also be employed. Formal and informal writing will be assigned, both to individuals and groups.
Communication of ideas at all levels will be stressed throughout the course.

##### Catalog Description 
Introduction to the history, geography, and religions of the Middle East from ancient to modern times, focusing on how this history helped shape the Middle East of today. Required of all Middle East studies majors.

### MESAS102-000: Intro to S. Asian Civilizatns#

##### Catalog Description 
This course is a multidisciplinary introduction to the civilizations of South Asia, including an overview of the history and historiography of the region from its prehistory to the present.

Semester Description
Content: In this course, we try to come an understanding of two rather commonly used words “civilization” and “culture,” with reference to the Indian subcontinent. We will take a long and a broad view of the subcontinent, and look into its history with view to understand the achievements of various time periods that impacted human thought, values and spiritual development.

We will study how in this geographical area human instincts of amassing wealth, enjoying sexual pleasure are controlled, modulated and celebrated to form societies of complex hierarchies of men and women.

Growth of religious and secular institutions, laws, and uMWritten rules of daily life across centuries constitute our main object of study. Most significantly we will ask what high values were enshrined and what weakness were accepted in the religious and ritual actions of people in this area, variously presented under cover words such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam to mention a few.

We will learn of the great achievements of human creativity in philosophy, literature, art, and architecture. We will follow the general time-line history offers, but would enquire into the very concept of time civilizations that flourished in this area held and believed in.

In the process of the enquiry, we will not treat South Asia as a self-contained bounded mass of land, but as an area of shifting regions which interacted with other regions of the world, giving and taking ideas, beliefs, lifestyles, technologies, narratives and institutional forms.

All this may appears rather abstract, but the material we use in this course is very concrete: epics, tales, myths, novellas, literary texts, and legends about holy men, kings and bandits. We will use documentaries and slides wherever possible. We will use texts in translation from different languages of this area-Sanskrit, Persian, Urdu, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu-from both written and oral traditions.

A certain amount reading and research is required, but what is more important is not just to read and repeat, but to discuss, interact, interpret, and ask questions.

##### Catalog Description 
This course surveys basic problems in philosophy, such as questions concerning truth, knowledge, justice, beauty, and the good.

##### Semester Description
Content: As the title suggests, the aim of the course is to introduce the student to the nature of  philosophical reasoning. Starting with two classic examples from Ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates and Plato, and continuing up to our own day, we shall consider issues that have captured the attention of some of the greatest thinkers the Western World has produced: What do we mean when we say we “know” something? What is the meaning of “truth”? Are we determined by various forces outside our control? Is free will a delusion? What makes an ethical decision ethical? Is it all relative? What is justice? Do we owe anything to future generations?

Finally, we shall read a philosophical novel, Albert Camus’ The Plague to see how crucial philosophical issues can be dramatized in the concrete.

##### Text

##### Semester Description
Content: “What is the good?” Having been raised in various forms as long as recorded history attests, the ubiquity of this question should not be surprising. We cannot help but orient ourselves towards various goals and projects, yet what guides us in these endeavors? Furthermore, what orients us towards living in the first place? Are we not seeking some good or perhaps the good? Happiness? Money? Pleasure? Tranquility? Are these things in fact goods? How would we determine this? Can we determine this?

Upon addressing this question, we will see that it opens onto a number of other fundamental questions: what is the nature of ethics/morality? Of human nature? Of knowledge? Thus, the course will not focus myopically on the question of “what is the good?” Rather, it will take the question as its focus and also as a springboard through which one can approach other fundamental questions. We will first start by surveying texts representative of the historically dominant ethical positions (virtue ethics, deontology, and utilitarianism), including selections from Aristotle, Kant, and Mill. We will then turn to contend with how these positions stand in relation to a multitude of others, such as skepticism, stoicism, naturalism, relativism, and absurdism, among others. We will grapple with religious conceptions of the good from texts in the Abrahamic religions, Hinduism, and Daoism and also with thinkers who constructively critique these conceptions, including Hume, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky. Readings may include selections from Plato, Epicurus, Marcus Aurelius, Sextus Empiricus, Boethius, Marx, Emerson, Kafka, Dewey, Buber, Camus, Derrida, Levinas, Kundera, Frankl, and Nussbaum.

### PHIL100-002:Basic Problems in Philosophy#

##### Catalog Description 
This course surveys basic problems in philosophy, such as questions concerning truth, knowledge, justice, beauty, and the good.

##### Semester Description
Content: ‘Philosophy’ in the original Greek sense of the term means loving wisdom, but loving it in a specific way, as you would love a friend. By way of an introduction to philosophy, this course will focus on friendship—What does it mean to be a friend? How is being a friend different than being an enemy or just an acquaintance? Who can be your friend and who can you befriend? And perhaps most importantly, what is at stake in the capacity to be a friend to yourself? In turning and returning to these questions, we will focus the course by reading several dialogues by Plato, Descartes’ Meditations, several Emersonian essays, Elaine Scarry’s On Beauty and Being Just, and as a capstone to the course will watch a film entitled The Examined Life in which contemporary philosophers discuss what interests them about philosophy and why. We will also read several shorter selections by thinkers such as Nietzsche, Arendt, Cavell, and Foucault. This course will have both lecture and discussion components and course requirements will include several writing assignments and meetings with the instructor. This course is open to all students.

##### Semester Description
Content: As philosophic historian Max Fisch writes, “It is increasingly apparent that American philosophy had its classical period, corresponding to the Greek classical period–Democritus through Aristotle.” This course will examine that period, roughly from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War II. We will proceed in three stages. First, we will examine pragmatism in concept (Charles Sanders Peirce) and action (William James). Then, we will study two modes of idealism: spirited (George Santayana) and logical (Josiah Royce). Finally, we will follow the evolution of mind (John Dewey) and civilization (Alfred North Whitehead). Along the way we will ask to what extent the classical epoch might reveal or determine the American character.

The course will examine the most significant philosophical concepts and traditions in Asian thought.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course will use the themes of mind and person as a lens for engaging with Indian and East Asian philosophical thought.  Drawing from texts in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen, we will investigate the nature of selfhood within these traditions.  What does it mean to be a person, and what is the nature of mind? How can our everyday experience of ourselves be compared or contrasted with what is understood as ultimate truth and/or enlightened mind? How does this understanding of self translate into skillful engagement with others and the world?

This course will be conducted as a seminar with an emphasis on discussion.

##### Semester Description
Content: What is the good life? Does moral value inhere in actions, motives for action, or the consequences of actions?  Can a prescriptive ethics be discovered, or are human beings limited solely to descriptive exercises in moral psychology?  The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the field of ethics, a tradition spanning thousands of years and no less relevant today than at its inception.  This course will be divided into three main sections.  The first section will consist of a broad overview of classic ethical philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, and Sartre.  In the second section, we will analyze contemporary moral philosophers and moral psychologists as they have taken up (or refused to take up) their predecessors.  The final section will focus on a few specific ethical issues, to be determined by the interests of students with relevant materials selected by the instructor.  By the conclusion of the course, the students will have not only gained factual knowledge and critically engaged with the discipline, but also reflected upon the development and processes of their own moral faculties.

##### Catalog Description
This course should encourage you to uncover and explore assumptions and evaluations concerning the so-called 'natural world' or 'environment.' Each individual and society exists within an environment, and the character of this relation not only influences the relations of human and non-human creatures, but also lies at the heart of human self-understanding. Through reflection upon these and related issues, this course will develop critical reading, writing, and thinking skills by way of an introduction to and encounter with contemporary issues in environmental philosophy.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course provides an overview of conceptions of nature in the history of philosophy. Beginning with the Stoic author Marcus Aurelius, we examine the connection between nature, human rationality, and ethical obligation. This vision of nature as a whole is continued in the work of Spinoza, whose Ethics provides a monistic account of a nature that continually acts upon itself. This leads us to consider a developmental account of nature as found in the work of Darwin. The course concludes with an examination of the interface between nature and society in a reading of Thoreau’s Walden and a survey of the history of gardens (Harrison). One or two extra-curricular activities are currently in the planning.

Examination of a broad range of moral and social issues, such as abortion, capital punishment, sexism, war, environmental policy, euthanasia, and racism.

##### Semester Description
Content: From Socrates to Antonio Gramsci, Boethius to Angela Davis, the experience of incarceration has sharpened the moral focus of many philosophers. This section will seek to illuminate the complexity of the web of moral issues faced when thinking about, through, in, and against incarceration. Today, in the USA, mass incarceration is perpetually expanding, inside and outside U.S. Borders, under public and private governance. More and more incarceration is used to halt diverse matters, from substance use to immigration to public assembly. This section will bring into focus the many correlated aspects and factors of moral decision making on the personal, social, and political levels in relation to this arresting contemporary moral issue.

##### Semester Description
Content: This course introduces us to some of the most important sources of Western political thought and seeks to develop skills to critically assess these sources and the place they occupy in our imagination and practices. Some of the main ideas we will consider include the following:  freedom and autonomy, the social contract, human nature, morality, political friendship, obligation and consent, sovereignty, and slavery and domination. We will also consider some larger historical questions such as the changing conceptions of individual identity, the importance of religion to political society, the possibility for moral truth, and the problem of inequality in society. Some possible thinkers we will cover include: Sophocles, Socrates, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Alexis De. Tocqueville, John Dewey, and W. E. B. Du Bois. This course will be treated as a lecture rather than a seminar.

This course is an introduction to the central issues in feminist philosophy.

##### Semester Description
content: Feminist theory questions the social, political, and intellectual subordination of women that has characterized much of history, but it is by no means limited to women. This course will explore feminists who have made progress by seeking equality with men, and the ways that more progress still needs to be made. We will also read feminists who reject the ideal of equality in favor of sexual difference and a reevaluation of ‘feminine’ values. Feminist theorists explore issues of identity and difference, gender and sexuality, hierarchy and equality, nature and culture, and race. In this course, students will be encouraged to critically engage with contemporary issues on the basis of our theoretical readings, and we will utilize sources such as film, TV, advertisements, and legal cases. We will read thinkers such as Simone de Beauvoir, Mary Wollstonecraft, Luce Irigaray, bell hooks, Martha Nussbaum, Hélène Cixous, and Iris Marion Young in tandem with excerpts from Disney movies, the Twilight series, contemporary art, and traditional philosophers’ statements about women and femininity. We will ultimately find that feminists draw all of us toward a greater understanding of our own lives and identities whether we are male or female.

This course will cultivate critical thinking and writing skills, as well as emphasize close reading and discussion. Assessment will be made on the basis of papers, blog posts, and participation. Film viewings will occasionally replace Friday meetings.

##### Catalog Description 
This course is an introduction to central issues in the philosophy of science: (1)scientific explanation. (2)evidence and verification. (3)probability theory. (4)the relation of science and politics.

##### Semester Description
Content: The great physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman is said to have once remarked that philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds. Perhaps. But that doesn't mean a philosophical understanding of science isn't useful to non-scientists. And it is hard to see why scientists (or birds!) don't also stand to gain from having some knowledge about themselves and their history above and beyond the technical skills of their disciplines.

For there is clearly something unique about science and the knowledge scientists produce. But what is it that makes it so unique and powerful? Is it the product of a revolutionary “scientific” method or is there rather really only a blooming, buzzing confusion of methods and tools which scientists use whenever it suits them? Does science really make progress or does it merely change along with the changing needs of scientists and their societies?  And just what do scientific theories and explanations tell us about the world, anyway? Do they really discover the Truth with a capital T?

This class will attempt to address these and similar questions about the nature of science and scientific knowledge. Our approach will be historical, beginning with the 17th century and ending with some of the best of contemporary theories. Our main topic will be the history and philosophy of physics, but topics in the biological sciences will also be treated.

No background in either philosophy or science is expected (although it wouldn't hurt to have had some exposure to physics and biology at the high school level).

##### Semester Description
“I am sitting with a philosopher in a garden; he says again and again 'I know that this is a tree,' pointing to a tree that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell him: 'This fellow is not insane. We are only doing philosophy.'” -Wittgenstein, On Certainty

Whether we are conscious of them or not, our beliefs about the nature of the world shape our actions and expectations of ourselves, our environment, and other people. What we think we can claim to know and what claims put forth by others are thought to be true are often determined without the question of what counts as justification being raised. “How do you know there were two people chatting in the garden?” “I saw them there.” Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the study of knowledge, and delves into such questions as how it is we form beliefs, which beliefs ought to count as knowledge, what qualifies as justification for a belief, and why we have reason to believe that our view of the world is true. Answers to these questions, or the potential impossibility of answering these questions, are important for individual, social, scientific, and political life and practice.

This class is an introduction to the ways in which philosophers have approached the problems of belief, truth and knowledge. The course will start with Plato and ancient skepticism, before moving to modern philosophy and will conclude with a brief foray into 20th century and contemporary approaches to epistemology.

##### Catalog Description 
What is distinctive about a human being? What did it mean to be a human in ancient times, as it differs from what it means in modernity? Who are we, and what are our possibilities? What can we become? The responses to these questions affect our ethics, our politics, and the meaning of our lives.

##### Semester Description
Content: What is human nature? What makes humans different from animals? Are there uniquely human characteristics? And if so, are they universal and belong to us innately or are they culture-relative and depend on our upbringing? This course will provide a philosophical analysis of several classical responses to these questions and will reveal the mythological character of some of them.  We will read the accounts of human nature by some ancient sources and modern philosophers, and we will consider contemporary criticisms of them.

The course will be organized in three relatively independent sections. The first section of the course will focus on classical myths concerning (a) the origins of human beings, (b) the relationship between nature and civilization and (c) the egoism vs. altruism question. In the second part of the course, we will examine the significance of the evolution theory for our conception of human nature, and we will learn some lessons from evolution concerning the nature of our emotions. Finally, in the third section, we will deal with the contemporary debate between situationism and character-based theories regarding the existence of character traits.

Study and analysis of the thought of one major philosopher or the study of a special problem or set of related problems in philosophy.

##### Semester Description
Content: 
This first-year seminar considers critically questions of value that are central to human life.  Are moral values or the value of human life absolute?  Are they relative?  Is it possible to reason about values at all, and is it possible to establish that some values are more justified than others?  If so, how?  And, what is the relation between moral theory and moral practice--actually leading a good life and being a good person.  This course introduces students to these questions and related issues that every person inescapably must confront.  The course approaches these topics in two ways:  through the writings of several key thinkers in the history of philosophy (including Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, Dewey, and Camus) and through recent analyses of the contemporary moral issues that deal with issues of absolutism and relativism.  The course focuses not simply on understanding this material but on critical reflection on human values--both one's own values and those of others; ultimately, the course focuses on the application of this reflection to action in daily life.

####Catalog Description
For first-year students only. Entry level seminar focusing on a specific topic. May be repeated for credit when topic varies.

####Semester Description
Content: Communism may seem like something that happened long ago and far away, the stuff of grainy newsreels and chapters in history textbooks: images of military parades, smoke-belching factories, and peasant villages that may be twenty, but might as well be fifty or a hundred years old. This era is so far removed from our everyday experience that it may be difficult to believe that it happened at all. At the same time, our television screens are filled with daily accounts of economic hardships, rampant crime, ethnic violence and political demagoguery that appear to prevail in the post-communist world. This course will seek to bridge the gap between the almost fictional quality of pre-1989 communism and its real, present-day consequences for the lives of ordinary people. It will explore the nature of communist and post-communist politics by combining seminar discussions with weekly screenings of full-length, non-documentary films. In doing so, it will bring into sharp focus the types of choices, dilemmas and commitments that were part of everyday life in communist systems and which continue to shape the mind sets of many individuals to this day.

Content: This seminar will begin with a basic grounding in three areas of psychology: 1) psychoanalytic, behavioral, and interactional approaches to personality; 2) family dynamics; and 3) psychological and social development from childhood to old age. Using this information about real people, five current works of fiction will be read and analyzed. Emphasis will be on the manner in which psychological knowledge can be applied not only to the characters and plots in the novels, but to their writers as well. Further focus will be on the ways in which knowledge gained from fictional characters can be applied to the understanding of real-life people and situations. Students will be required to prepare three term papers and to participate actively in class discussions.

####Semester Description 
Content: Brain imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are transforming many areas of psychology by providing a unique new window into mental processes as they unfold in the human brain.  This course will explore the methods and findings of structural and functional neuroimaging studies across a variety of psychological topics including memory, emotion, perception, language, mental illness, and social behavior.  The goal is to familiarize studens with how neuroimaging studies are designed, conducted, and interpreted, and to understand what they can tell us about psychological phenomena.  For each topic, the emphasis will be on separating scientific fact from popular mythology and stimulating critical thinking.  A variety of formats will be used including lecture, class discussion, video presentations, and demonstrations.

####Semester Description 
Content: Everyday, we are bombarded by efforts from other people to change our attitudes or behavior; vote for this candidate, buy this product, follow these rules. Sometimes, the pressure to change is subtle and indirect and sometimes, it is blatant and direct. Why are these attempts to change our attitudes and behavior so often successful? This seminar will begin with a consideration of the three main types of social influence: compliance, conformity and obedience. We will then examine their role in shaping our attitudes and behavior as we go about the business of daily life. We will be looking at these questions primarily from the perspective of social psychological research, but will also incorporate material from books, movies and other types of popular media.

####Semester Description
An exploration of diverse ways of being religious (for example, in thought, action, community, and experience) as they are displayed in several traditions and cultures.

####Semester Description
Content: This course is an introduction to the study of religions, to the comparison of religions, and to the relations between religions. In this case, we focus on Buddhism and Christianity.

We will begin with short introductions to "Buddhism" and "Christianity." This will obviously supply only a bare minimum of information and vocabulary, but during the rest of the course we will learn more about each religion by considering them in relation.

“Comparison” is not a simple matter. We discuss the etiquette of dialogue with other peoples’ religions; "hermeneutic good will" and “epoche”; attention to the voices we listen to and the voices we speak with; and the possible goals and desires of such encounters.

We will analyze some examples of Christians talking about Buddhism, Buddhists talking about Christianity, and inter-religious dialogue.

Still, for every case of dialogue, there are many more that are simply polemical—intended to show that one is right and one is wrong. The last part of the course concerns polemics.  Rather than simply viewing polemics as a failure of dialogue, rather than simply viewing bias as a reason to stop reading, might there be some ways to “salvage” polemics, to learn something true from a biased representation?

####Semester Catalog:
Content: This course will examine the complex social, historical, and intellectual forces that impact the relationships between religion and politics across space and time. Students will first explore the historical genealogy of Western notions about the ideal relationship between religion, politics, and the public square. Next, we will draw from several disciplinary approaches in order to better understand particular case studies, including: Islam, democracy, and social movements in contemporary Egypt and Iran; Hindu nationalism in post-colonial India; and, the relationship between Christianity and electoral politics in the United States. Students will learn about the role of religious ideology and symbolism, yet they will also explore how religious explanations for politics can also obscure more enduring histories of political and economic power relations.

####Catalog Description
This course will explore classic religious texts in depth, developing skills to interpret sacred, philosophical and ethical works. Social, cultural, and/or philosophical contexts at work will provide interpretive frameworks.

####Semester Description 
Content: Consider two iconic titles in religious studies: “From Medicine Men to Muhammad” (1967) and “From Primitives to Zen” (1974).  Coined by the eminent religion scholar Mircea Eliade, they are NOT among the books assigned for this course on Classic Religious Texts. But they vividly indicate the first of a two-stage approach that we will take in studying classic religious texts. The first stage traces the evolution of humanity from the mythic and ritual worlds of our indigenous religions—the world of “medicine men” shamans and native spiritual experts on the one hand, to today’s world religions East and West—and the theologies and the philosophies that have emerged or diverged from them. But the second stage highlighted in this course is potentially more engaging for today’s students of religion and culture. Revisiting the modern interest in going beyond the indigenous and the primitive, we will explore a postmodern interest in returning to myth and ritual via some of those same classic texts of religion and literature, theology and philosophy; going ‘back to the future’ or ‘back again from ritual to philosophy.’

####Catalog Description
This course examines western religions over a significant span of history, special emphasis on interactions between culture and religion and between religions; topic varies.

####Semester Description
The “Holy Land” (Israel/Palestine) plays a significant role in three of the world’s major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, closely-related traditions with long and complex histories of contact, conflict, and cooperation.  The “Holy Land” is also important for two other religious communities, which have roots in Islam (the Druze and the Baha’is).  This course will serve as an introductory and survey course on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (with some additional attention to the Druze and Baha’is).  A major component of the course will be a ‘virtual pilgrimage/tour’ of the “Holy Land,” in which we will explore its fraught history and present-day realities as a focus of devotion, competition and cooperation amongst Jews, Christians, Muslims, Druze, and Baha’is. The course is intended to provide both breadth of knowledge and some depth of understanding on key elements of the five traditions, which can serve as a basis for work in more focused and specialized courses on these traditions.  The course also functions, more generally, as an introduction to the academic historical and comparative study of religion.  No prior knowledge or study of any of the traditions is assumed or required, nor is any particular religious commitment.

####Catalog Description
This seminar focuses on modern Buddhist history, society, and thought. Issues addressed may include colonization, women's ordination, meditation movements, conversion, eco-Buddhism, immigration, and globalization.

####Semester Description
Content: Since the Buddha's enlightenment, the Buddhist tradition has taken root and flourished in numerous cultures, both transforming and being transformed by each society it has encountered. In North America this process began in the 19th century, with the arrival of tens of thousands of Chinese and Japanese immigrants, and the interest of Euro-American intellectuals, artists, merchants, and wealthy dilettantes.  From the 1960s oMWards, the number of Asian-American Buddhists and interest in Buddhism among non-Asian Americans has escalated dramatically, so that Buddhism is now an integral part of North America's religiously plural, rapidly changing demographic landscape.

This class traces this fascinating historical and sociological process, focusing particularly on Buddhist groups and centers within easy reach of Emory. Throughout, we will also investigate such issues as Orientalism, identity formation, immigration, conversion, trans-nationalism, and religious pluralism in our attempts to understand the Buddhism(s) of America today. Since His Holiness the Dalai Lama will be at Emory during the fall semester, our class will attend Tibet-related events leading up to and during his visit, using these experiences to investigate the transformation of Tibetan Buddhism in America, and right here on our campus.

Examination of religious existence and its relation to various aspects of human life by approaches developed in major traditions of psychological study.
####Semester Description:##
Content: This course will explore the distinctive features of experiential psychologies in relation to religious commitments and traditions. Significantly it is a theory-practice course that incorporates experiential learning in addition to textual and research methods. In particular the course will include a practicum in peer counseling (co-counseling) that involves practicing (a) active listening skills, (b) sensitivity in engaging interpersonal and intergroup relationships and dynamics, and (c) the application of basic mediation and conflict resolution behaviors. In addition the readings explore on practices and successes of psychodrama and other experiential psychotherapies. As a religious studies course, however, the focus remains on understanding religious phenomena and traditions from these experiential and psychological perspectives.

####Catalog Description
The relation of sexuality and the sacred in symbolism, attitudes and practice; authentic human communion; and specific problems of sexual ethics.

####Semester Description
Content: Like death, sexuality is a biological fact of life—an inescapable reality of the world we live in, a force at work in every nook and cranny of society and culture, found in the home, office, mall, classroom, hospital; imaged on television, computer, theater, and mental screens; aroused at sporting events, clubs, parties, funerals, and weddings.  It is no wonder sex, along with death and health, is of the utmost importance in the world’s religious traditions, most of which seek to regulate and monitor the body generally, but most especially the terms on and by which sexual desires can be fulfilled or transgressed.  Religious traditions thrive on intimacy with and access to the body, its experience of suffering, sorrow, and sickness, as well as rapture, delight, and bliss.  Its obvious and overwhelming role as a primary, primal factor in evolution and communication throughout the animal kingdom makes sexuality even more confounding to humans who are animals but not only animals, a species that makes much more of sexual relations than a biological imperative to secure a fertilized egg. The powers of sex, however, are entangled in phenomena that cannot be reduced to bodily processes, or easily measured with brain-imaging technologies.  How these powers are defined and understood varies across and within cultures but they are never simply neutral and always bear on the sacred.  The intricacies of sexuality in human cultures—its political, economic, mythic, moral, ritual, emotional dimensions—belie any easy generalizations.  This course will explore the connections and intersections linking religion and sexuality across different religious cultures, within the history of Christianity, and in American society in the past and present.

####Catalog Description
nalysis of methods and/or texts pertaining to ethical decision-making for individual and social problems such as race, sex/marriage, justice, war, biomedical technology, and environmental pollution. May be repeated for credit when topic varies.


####Semester Description
Content: His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama is one of the leading thinkers of our time, and the focus of his work involves promoting basic human values and interreligious harmony. His work in these two fields has provided him the opportunity to engage in dialogue with renowned scientists, researchers, education specialists, and world leaders in addition to religious leaders of all faiths. With the turn of the century, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has called for a new kind of education one that examines a set of fundamental human values that are the basis of our shared humanity and pay homage to the interdependent nature of our increasingly globalized society. Modern scientific research is showing that our capacity for compassion, empathy, and love is deeply ingrained, and His Holiness has many teachings that can help us learn to cultivate these positive qualities. His Holiness’s books, Ethics for the New Millennium and Beyond Religion Ethics for a Whole World, outline what he refers to as “secular ethics,” an idea of a set of ethics that is not dependent on a particular belief system or religious framework but is instead universal and inclusive of people of all or no religious affiliation. In essence, His Holiness is proposing an approach to ethics that is grounded in scientific evidence and supported by both personal experience and common sense. In this course, students will study principles of His Holiness’s secular ethics and engage in thoughtful discussion of how to infuse these ideals into aspects of our society such as education, family life, and other social structures. Grading will be based on an intensive group project and an individual final paper, as well as class participation and weekly responses.

The British poet and critic Matthew Arnold wrote that readers should regard Anna Karenina not so much as a work of art but as a “piece of life.”  This course will use Tolstoy’s  novel as a point of entry into a multifaceted exploration of Russian culture and society in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Topics to be examined include: political and social reform; evolving societal attitudes towards women; family and sexual relations; marriage and divorce; religion and spirituality; Russian attitudes towards nature and national consciousness. Students will be writing short essays and a final paper.

####Semester Description
Fulfills GER freshman seminar requirement. Seminar will introduce students to special topics in Russian and East European studies with a cross-disciplinary approach.

####Semester Description
Content: Life in the East European Jewish shtetl was not all about prayer and dairy farming; there was also interfaith romance, runaway brides, and homosexual attraction.  This seminar will explore gender and sexuality in prewar Eastern Europe society and culture, and ask how modernity affected marriage, love, and the Jewish family.  In probing gender and sexual identities in Ashkenazi and Yiddish culture, we will critically reassess the shtetl mythology of prewar Eastern Europe and the trope of the East European Jewish family as the bulwark of tradition against the encroachments of modernity.  Topics of study include: the East European Jewish Enlightenment and the feminized Jewish man; Jewish women and the mass politics of Zionism, socialism and revolution; cross-dressing and transgendered dreams in Yiddish fiction; and female converts and their anxious Jewish families.  We will pair our readings in history and literature with films and contemporary media coverage of sexual politics in the new “shtetls” of Israel and America.  Films include: Yentl, Fiddler on the Roof, Trembling before God, and The Dybbuk.  Seminar titles include: “The Real Jewish Housewives of Vilna: Extramarital Affairs and Single Motherhood”; “Hasidism, the Heder, and Homo-eroticism”; and “The Sexual Politics of Language and Education in Traditional Societies”.  Together, we will learn how to “read” history from the margins, and use provocative texts and arguments to better understand historical change even in times and places that seem the most resistant to it.

##### Catalog Description 
This course is an introduction to the theories, themes and questions in the interdisciplinary field of women's, gender, and sexuality studies. The course is required for all majors and minors.

In this course, we will familiarize ourselves with key concepts and central debates within the field of women’s, gender, and sexuality studies. The following questions will drive our examination of feminist thought within and across an array of disciplines: What is feminism? How do we understand the emergence of multiple feminisms? What is gender? What is sexuality? And how do they frame and impact our lived experiences? Throughout our explorations, we will strive to acknowledge workings of power and their relation to gender, sexuality, and other axes of identity, such as race, class, and ability. Topics of focus will include: diversity of gender and sexual expression (i.e., transgender, transexuality, and intersex), representations of gender and sexuality in society, sexual oppression and violence, histories of U.S. feminism(s) and activist movements therein, transnational feminism(s) and postcolonial theory, intersectionality and critical race theory, and reproductive politics. Screenings of contemporary film and cinema across an array of genres and geographical foci will accompany our course readings. *As such, this course may require outside film screen screenings.

##### Semester Description
Content: Gender and sexuality function both as dominant rubrics for structuring the world and as lenses by which we perceive it. A critical understanding of gender and sexuality, then, is essential for any kind of inquiry. This course serves as an introduction to the field of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies and to the social, political, and intellectual issues with which it is concerned. The topics we will cover include: the histories of feminism and Women's Studies in the United States as well as theories of gender, sexuality, power and identity. Because this is a survey course, we will not be able to cover each topic in detail but, by completing this course, you will be prepared to continue engaging in conversations about gender/sexuality, whether those conversations take place within the university or outside of it, within Women's, Gender and Sexuality studies or in any other department at Emory.

We will discuss intersecting identities of gender, race, class and sexuality and how they relate to feminism by examining the role of women in science and analyzing gendered science.  In addition to exploring the possibilities of incorporating feminist practices in the production of scientific knowledge, we will also investigate what science has to offer feminism as we reconceptualize our ideas of bodies and materiality.  Lastly, we will connect these discussions to popular representations of women, gender and biology in the media, with particular attention to the design and use of technologies such as cyborgs, reproductive technologies, cloning, and genetic engineering.
