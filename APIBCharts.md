|\* For all Group 1 and 2 courses it must be determined whether or not the student took the IB course in her or his native language. If the course was taken in the native language, elective credit only should be awarded. If the course was taken in a language other than the student's native language, then the indicated Emory equivalent should be awarded.||||
|\** This course equivalent is for the purpose of awarding credit only and does not indicate a student’s level of placement in a language. Students taking Language B exams may be placed in a higher language course and should take the relevant placement test to determine the appropriate course to take. ||||
|†A student may receive credit for only one English IB test and for one test in a particular language, either in Group 1 or Group 2.||||
|++Students who would like credit for ARTVIS 104 or 105 will need to consult with the Visual Arts department.||||
