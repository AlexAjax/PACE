|Vision | American Studies allows students to discover the complexity and diversity of this nation’s history, literature, and culture by drawing on multiple academic disciplines and social perspectives. In an intellectual climate of rigorous inquiry, students explore the role of ideas and events in the formation of American culture. We examine the connections between regional identity, racial conflict, popular culture, gender politics, capitalism, and global migration. Our classes encourage ethical engagement with the issues raised by scholarly interrogation of received wisdom and platitudes about American culture. We equip students with the habit of critical thinking and the skills in writing and speaking crucial to success in a wide variety of careers and vocations.|

|**ARAB  Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies – Arabic**||
|Vision| Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken language in the world. It is the language of a rich culture and a high civilization dating back many centuries. Arabic is the sacred language of the Qur’an and of Islam, used by over 1 billion Muslims as a vital part of their daily lives. It is the mother tongue of over 200 million people from Morocco to Iraq. Arabic is also spoken by millions of people living in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Arabic is the official language of twenty-one countries. The United Nations has adopted Arabic as its sixth official language. Much of the western philosophical and medical traditions were carried to the West through Arabic and Islamic Civilization. The Arabic script is known throughout the world for its elegance and beautiful calligraphic styles. Arabic script, in various different forms, has been used in a number of non-Arabic languages, such as Persian, Urdu, Pashto, Dari, Kurdish, Ottoman Turkish, and Indonesian Jawi. The importance of the Arab world as a center of oil resources, the birthplace of the three monotheistic religions, and a region of continuing political and economic challenges make Arabic a crucial language for business and world affairs. MESAS's Arabic program offers four years of instruction in the language as well as training for students with advanced levels of proficiency through independent study courses. MESAS has a partnership with Al-Akhawayn University in Morocco for summer study in intensive Arabic and North African Studies. Students from the MESAS Arabic program regularly receive fellowships to the Center for Arabic Study Abroad (CASA) program in Cairo, Egypt, and Critical Language Scholarships to Jordan, Oman, and Morocco. Students with prior knowledge of Arabic must consult the Arabic Language Coordinator Rkia Cornell for appropriate placement.|

GRK  Classics  Greek
|Vision|
The Department of Classics offers courses in ancient Greek at all levels from beginning through advanced. Introductory courses (GRK 101/102 or GRK 110) use innovative texts intended to get students reading authentic Greek texts quickly while learning the basics of the language. Intermediate courses (GRK 201 and 202) aim to develop students’ reading skills by reviewing and practicing fundamentals within the context of a single author such as Plato or Homer. Advanced courses focus on more adept reading and analysis of one or more major Greek authors such as Sophocles, Herodotus, or Aristophanes. We offer a major and minor in ancient Greek as well as a variety of other majors and minors in which Greek courses often play a role.

HEBR  Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies – Hebrew
|Vision|
Modern Hebrew is the language spoken in Israel—a country of constant importance on the world stage and one of the world’s fastest-growing high-tech economies—and in some Jewish communities worldwide. Hebrew is the original language of the Bible; it was resurrected at the turn of the twentieth century and brought back to full and vigorous life. The Department of Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies offers elementary, intermediate, and advanced Modern Hebrew courses, as well as classes on contemporary Israeli culture and supervised readings. MESAS also offers a minor in Hebrew. Hebrew students can pursue various summer intensive programs in the U.S. and Israel and take advantage of Emory study abroad programs at Tel Aviv and the Hebrew Universities year-round. Students with prior knowledge must consult the Hebrew Language Coordinator for appropriate placement.

HNDI  Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies – Hindi
|Vision|:
Hindi-Urdu is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, with more than 490 million native speakers. Its speakers can be found not only on the South Asian subcontinent (India & Pakistan), but throughout the world—including right here in Atlanta. Knowledge of Hindi-Urdu will open doors to the rich and diverse history and cultural and artistic traditions of India and Pakistan. Because South Asia is an important and dynamic cultural, economic, and geo-strategic site, knowledge of Hindi-Urdu will also be useful for careers in business and finance, development and public health, medicine, government, journalism, and library and information science, among others. The Hindi-Urdu program at Emory offers instruction through the Devanagari writing system from elementary to advanced levels. An option to minor is also available. Students with prior knowledge of Hindi-Urdu must contact the Language Coordinator for appropriate placement.

Interested in Study Abroad Program but not major or minor:
Students who plan to study in Italy during their Junior year and are not interested in pursuing a minor:
a) If planning to be in Italy for their Fall semester of Junior year, they need to take Italian 101/102 during their Sophomore year
b) If planning to be in Italy for their Spring semester of Junior year, they can wait and take Italian 101 during the fall of their Junior year, or take 101/102 during their Sophomore year and then 201 in fall of the Junior year. 
In short, students should take Italian up to the semester of their departure for Italy.
If students have any thoughts about studying in Italy at some point during their college career, they should contact the program director for a personal appointment to determine the best language course solution for their needs.

LAT  Classics  Latin
|Vision|:
The Department of Classics offers courses in Latin at all levels from beginning through advanced. Introductory courses (LAT 101/102 or LAT 110) use innovative texts intended to get students reading authentic Latin texts while learning the basics of the language. Intermediate courses (LAT 201 and 202) aim to develop students’ reading skills by reviewing and practicing fundamentals within the context of a single author such as Apuleius or Ovid. Advanced courses focus on more adept reading and analysis of one or more major Latin authors such as Vergil, Catullus, or Petronius. We offer a major and minor in Latin as well as a variety of other majors and minors in which Latin courses often play a role.

PHYS  Physics
|Vision|
Physics department courses teach students about the fundamental properties of the physical world and also how things work. Students will learn about fundamental physical laws describing objects ranging in size from single atoms to galaxies, and also about applications of these laws in the modern world (e.g. understanding electricity, motion, energy, etc.).
Physics majors are well prepared for graduate school programs in physics as well as a wide variety of other disciplines such as engineering, medical school, law school, economics, finance (due to the strong math preparation), computer science, and more. Students not wishing to attend graduate school will find the physics major is also excellent preparation for a variety of careers.

SPAN/PORT  Spanish and Portuguese
|Vision|
The Department teaches Spanish and Portuguese languages and Hispanic and Lusophone literatures and cultures. Most courses, and all at the lower levels, are taught in Spanish and Portuguese, and classes are small so that students at all levels are given maximum opportunity to improve their language skills. Incoming students are required to take our online Spanish Language Placement Exam to help ensure that this development of language skills starts at the appropriate level.
First-Year Seminar(s) 
 PORT 190: Rio de Janeiro on the World Stage
|Prerequisites for Further Study|
Online placement exam: spanish.emory.edu
The department will email students an “Official Placement” notification. Official results can take up to two weeks if students do not take the placement exam by the August deadline (TBA). All incoming students and heritage or native speakers must take this online placement exam. Oxford continuees who have not taken a Spanish course at Oxford but who may have taken a placement exam at Oxford must take Emory's online placement exam before enrolling in a Spanish course on Emory campus. However, those Oxford students who have already started their study of Spanish at Oxford should enroll in the next Spanish course in their series. Please see our website for this information. Inaccurately completing the survey portion of the exam will delay the results, and providing false information on the survey portion of the exam constitutes a violation of the Emory Honor Code.

TBT  Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies – Tibetan
|Vision|
Tibetan in its various forms and dialects is spoken across the Tibetan plateau and throughout the northern Himalayas. Although many Tibetan dialects are mutually incomprehensible, they all share a literary language whose roots extend back at least to the importation of Buddhism from India to Tibet in the seventh century.
At Emory, courses focus on teaching “Standard Tibetan,” a form of Tibetan that may be used across regions and has close affinities to the language as spoken in Central Tibet. As in the study of all languages, the study of Tibetan brings with it the potential for much greater understanding of the people who speak the language and their culture. The diversity of Tibetan language reflects the diversity of Tibetans themselves—from traders to aristocrats, from laymen to monks, from farmers to nomads. The study of Tibetan is the first step toward entry into the world of the Tibetan people.

WGS  Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
|Vision|
Women, gender, and sexuality are studied in relation to other important aspects of identity, including race, ethnicity, religion, class, disability, and nationality. Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies analyzes the ways in which social and institutional power is structured and it examines the meanings attached to these structures through interdisciplinary lenses. The departmental strengths are concentrated in the following four areas: 1) Race, Class, and Justice; 2) Globalization and Development; 3) Visual Culture, Narrative, and Ethics; and 4) Bodies, Sexualities, and Science.
